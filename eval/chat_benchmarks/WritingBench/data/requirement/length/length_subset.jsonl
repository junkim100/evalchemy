The following is the main text of my thesis: **Research Progress of Medical Image Analysis Based on Deep Convolutional Networks**\n\n1. Overview of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks  \nThe human brain is the information processing center, controlling human behavior and thought. To study the structure and function of the human brain's nervous system, biological neural networks were proposed. Inspired by this, computer researchers introduced artificial neural networks to simulate the structure and functioning of the human brain’s nervous system.  \nFrom an information processing perspective, an artificial neural network is a complex mathematical model that connects a large number of mathematical functions in the form of neurons. The transmission of information between neurons is similar to the transfer of hormones between adjacent nerve cells in the brain. The number of neurons, the connection method, internal parameters, and activation functions differ to form various neural network structures. The simplest type of artificial neural network is called a single-layer perceptron, consisting of one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer, as shown in Figure 1. Because this structure is too simple to handle complex computations, its application is limited.  \nMultilayer neural networks, also known as multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), have multiple hidden layers and are valuable artificial neural networks for practical applications. The most typical multilayer neural network model is the backpropagation (BP) neural network invented by Rumelhart et al.  \n\nFigure 1: Single-Layer Neuron Structure  \n\nWith the advancement of computer power and mathematical logic, multilayer neural network structures have become increasingly complex and diverse. Deep learning algorithms represented by CNNs further expand the depth and breadth of computer algorithms simulating human cognitive domains. As shown in Figure 2, a typical CNN structure consists of one input layer, one output layer, several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. This network structure performs better than traditional multilayer neural networks in computer vision tasks because convolutional layers and pooling layers can reduce the number of weight parameters that need to be trained by using parameter sharing and partial discarding methods. This reduces network complexity, eases the computational load, and enables CNNs with the same depth to have stronger data processing and feature extraction capabilities than multi-layer perceptrons.  \nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the most widely applied convolutional neural networks in recent years. Unlike classic CNN models such as AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet, GAN consists of two independent network models: a generator and a discriminator, as shown in Figure 3. In most cases, both the generator and discriminator are implemented with CNNs. They act like adversaries: both independent and complementary, competing with each other and enhancing each other's performance.  \nThe GAN, consisting of two models, inherently has self-discrimination, self-optimization, and strong generalization abilities, achieving good results in image reconstruction and generation. Furthermore, improved GAN models such as Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) and Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle GAN) provide new solutions for complex computer vision tasks.\n\n2. Applications of CNNs in Medical Image Processing  \n2.1 Image Segmentation  \nImage segmentation involves dividing the target image into regions of interest, such as diseased organs, tissues, and tumors. Most medical images are grayscale, and they often suffer from uneven grayscale distribution, significant noise, and unclear or changing boundaries of tissues and organs, making them difficult to interpret and understand for non-professionals. Traditional image segmentation methods primarily use local physical features such as color, texture, and morphology for region-based and boundary-based segmentation. Common methods include clustering algorithms in traditional machine learning, such as fuzzy C-means (FCM) for magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation, K-means clustering and Watershed algorithms for image segmentation, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based image segmentation, among others. These methods mainly utilize local physical information and do not fully utilize the semantic information contained in the image itself.\n\nFigure 2: Typical Convolutional Neural Network Structure  \nFigure 3: Basic Framework of Generative Adversarial Networks  \n\nCNNs, with their multi-node and multi-layered structure, have the ability to automatically extract deep features from input data, making them more suitable for image classification or regression tasks. Thanks to the advent of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), image segmentation tasks have found new solutions. FCNs replace the final fully connected layers of the classical CNN model with convolutional layers and, through deconvolution and skip connection operations, generate output feature maps that are the same size as the input image, rather than one-dimensional feature vectors representing probabilities. This method not only solves pixel-level classification tasks but also provides a solution for image segmentation tasks.  \nSince then, numerous models based on FCN have been proposed, with the most successful model being U-Net. U-Net is named for its network structure, which resembles the letter \"U.\" It continues FCN's use of full convolution, deconvolution, and skip connections, and achieves output images the same size as input images through a symmetric encoder-decoder structure. Similar models include 3D U-Net, VNet, and V-NAS.  \nApplications of these models in medical image segmentation include brain tumor segmentation, pancreas segmentation, heart segmentation, and retinal vessel segmentation. Research has shown that CNN-based segmentation methods provide better segmentation accuracy than traditional methods, and the results are closer to true labels.  \nFurthermore, image segmentation tasks often require supervised training with labeled data, but labeling medical images is difficult to obtain. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed using GANs to generate image labels, transforming supervised image segmentation tasks into semi-supervised or unsupervised tasks. For example, Kamnitsas et al. proposed an unsupervised domain adaptation method based on GAN for brain lesion segmentation; Dong et al. proposed a U-Net-GAN network based on U-Net and GAN to segment multiple risky organs in chest CT images; Dai et al. proposed a structural correction adversarial network based on GAN to assist chest X-ray image segmentation using generated organ labels.\n\n2.2 Image Reconstruction  \nMedical images are easily affected by equipment or environmental factors during acquisition, leading to noise or metal artifacts that degrade image quality. Additionally, issues such as image damage, loss, or incomplete information often occur. Using computer technology for medical image reconstruction is an important means of improving diagnostic accuracy.  \nImage reconstruction involves simulating and modeling part of the features of the acquired image to complete missing images or reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. Conventional image modeling methods include contour methods, brightness methods, trajectory methods, and texture methods. These methods extract local physical features from sample images using traditional image processing operations and reconstruct the images pixel by pixel, which is computationally complex and inefficient. CNNs' multi-layered nonlinear structure can automatically learn effective image features and reconstruct images based on those features, offering strong generalization and higher-quality generated images.  \nFor example, Yang et al. proposed a fast compressed sensing MRI reconstruction model based on GAN that allows for image reconstruction in only 0.22 to 0.37 seconds, with high-quality results; Mardani et al. used a GAN framework to model various diagnostic quality MRI images from historical patients, using internal similarities and prior knowledge to reconstruct high-quality, detailed texture images; Yuan et al. proposed an MRI reconstruction method based on the self-attention mechanism and GAN theory that achieved good results in detail restoration; Vedula et al. proposed using simulation ultrasound radio frequency data obtained from real CT scans to reconstruct high-quality CT images; Hun et al. proposed using subsampled RF data to reconstruct ultrasound images.  \nMany examples of applying CNNs in image reconstruction exist, and while the technology is mature, its practical applications are still not stable due to varying modeling data quality, requiring further exploration and optimization.\n\n2.3 Image Generation  \nMedical images come in various types, and different imaging methods provide different valuable information. However, due to uncontrollable factors such as patient discomfort, long scan times, high costs, and equipment malfunctions, doctors are often unable to obtain multimodal medical images of patients, making it difficult to perform comprehensive evaluations and accurate diagnoses of complex diseases.  \nSimilar to image reconstruction, image generation involves synthesizing or transforming one image into another using partial features of the input image. Based on the degree of difference between the input and output images, image generation can be divided into target image synthesis and image transformation. Image synthesis generally uses the original GAN model because the basic application of original GAN is to fit a data distribution using random noise and then sample new data. Image synthesis can be considered an image enhancement technique. Typical applications include Han et al. synthesizing multi-sequence brain MR slice images using the original GAN model and Kwon et al. successfully synthesizing 3D brain MR images from random data by combining the advantages of variational autoencoders and GAN. This method does not require source domain data guidance but only needs clearly featured and textured target domain images for reference. However, the training of the network model takes a long time, and the generated image quality is not high.  \nThe second type of application is based on an improved conditional GAN, where the input image serves as a condition. The input image provides guiding information and constrains the direction of the new image synthesis. Therefore, the generated images have higher quality and faster algorithm convergence. For example, Nie et al. used a 3D FCN as a generator and combined it with an automatic context model (ACM) to achieve MR to CT image conversion; Kaiser et al. used CNN and GAN to efficiently convert MRI to CT images; Qi Mengke et al. completed the conversion of head and neck tumor MR images to CT images based on GAN.  \nAdditionally, CGAN-based methods require two sets of images to correspond to each other, but often the data obtained do not meet this requirement, so Cycle GAN-based applications are becoming increasingly popular. For example, Hiasa et al. applied Cycle GAN to unpaired brain CT and MR images to achieve MR to CT conversion; Ben-Cohen et al. combined FCN and GAN to generate simulated PET images from given CT images; Sikka et al. proposed an end-to-end GAN model combining global and local perception to generate fluorodeoxyglucose PET images from MR images; Xiao Chenchen et al. proposed a method integrating residual blocks and GAN for cross-modal PET image synthesis.  \nIt is evident that applying GANs in medical image generation has already yielded many groundbreaking results. Currently, the technology is becoming mature and is expected to be widely applied in various medical scenarios in the future.\n\n3. Conclusion  \nWith the powerful learning ability and feature extraction capability provided by the multi-layer convolutional structure, CNNs have achieved great success in many image analysis and processing tasks. This paper outlines the origin, development, and common applications of neural networks in medical image processing, explaining the advantages and efficiency of using CNNs in medical image segmentation, reconstruction, and generation.  \nThe research on CNN applications in medical image processing began in 2016 and has developed alongside the deep learning boom. Initially, researchers only used neural networks for image classification prediction, but with the introduction of FCN and UNet, medical image segmentation tasks became widely studied. In recent years, the development of GANs has accelerated the advancement of medical image reconstruction and generation tasks.  \nFrom the current literature, it can be seen that applying CNNs to medical image processing has already led to some valuable research outcomes. However, these results are still mostly academic and have not yet been widely implemented. Academic results measure algorithm effectiveness at the theoretical level, with experimental results obtained in controlled environments and samples, lacking clinical diagnostic or training results. Therefore, the robustness of the algorithms still needs to be explored, and it is difficult to meet the hardware facility requirements to support these algorithms. From an algorithm optimization perspective, GANs, as generative models, can synthesize nearly real fake samples from a small number of training samples and are expected to be an important method for solving medical image processing tasks.  \nBased on the current information, GANs are mainly used in medical image reconstruction and generation tasks, with some involvement in image segmentation, but they are mostly used for generating image labels to assist segmentation tasks.

Based on the thesis topic and the literature reviewed, write a literature review of approximately 2000 words:  \n\n**Exchange rate** is the ratio of one country's currency to another country's currency. It is one of the most important comprehensive price indicators in international economic activities and plays a crucial role in price conversion in international finance and trade. Its fluctuations have a profound impact on the balance of foreign trade and domestic economic activity.  \n\n### **Literature Review**  \n\n#### **I. Research Background and Significance**  \n\nWith the continuous development of economic globalization, foreign trade serves as a crucial driver of economic growth, promoting the efficient allocation of resources, the introduction of advanced technologies, equipment, and management methods. It plays a pivotal role in the rapid development of China's economy, reflecting China's position in international division of labor, its importance in global economic exchanges and cooperation, and the degree of integration between China’s economy and the global economy.  \n\nThe exchange rate, as the ratio of one country's currency to another's, is a key comprehensive price indicator in international economic activities. It connects domestic and international prices and determines the relative prices of goods and services in international trade. Exchange rate fluctuations significantly impact a country's trade balance and domestic economic activity. Many countries adjust their exchange rates to balance their trade.  \n\nAs China becomes more integrated into the global economy, the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on foreign trade has become increasingly significant. Since 1981, China has adopted a dual exchange rate system. In 1994, the RMB exchange rate was established as a managed floating exchange rate based on market supply and demand. By 1996, China achieved full convertibility of the RMB under the current account. Today, under the \"pegged to the U.S. dollar\" system, every major adjustment in the nominal and real RMB exchange rates has been closely linked to import and export trade conditions. The periodic fluctuations of the RMB exchange rate have had a profound impact on exports and imports, and there is a significant correlation between changes in the real effective exchange rate of the RMB and the development of China's foreign trade.  \n\nSince the 1997 Southeast Asian financial crisis, China's foreign trade has been severely affected, prompting calls for RMB devaluation to boost exports. Over the years, Western countries have continued to pressure China to appreciate the RMB. The UK first published the \"Cheap Chinese Currency\" argument in 2001, promoting the so-called \"China threat theory.\" The U.S. officially stated that it hoped for a more flexible RMB exchange rate. In 2002, Japan proposed a scheme at the OECD G7 meeting, urging RMB appreciation and attempting to create a second \"Plaza Accord.\" In 2003, Japan accused China of exporting deflation to Asian countries. The motivation behind Western developed countries’ efforts to force RMB appreciation stems from China's massive trade surplus, capital account surplus, and large foreign exchange reserves.  \n\nThe issue of RMB exchange rate fluctuations has become a hot topic in international discussions, particularly concerning global trade balance and China’s trade balance. Key questions include: How much do exchange rate fluctuations impact China's trade balance and trade surplus? Can China use exchange rate policy to stimulate export growth, improve the structure of imports and exports, and further promote economic development? Can RMB appreciation balance China's trade balance without disrupting the country’s steady economic growth, thereby addressing concerns from Western countries about an undervalued RMB?  \n\n### **II. Current Research Status at Home and Abroad**  \n\n#### **(1) Domestic Research Status**  \n\n- *Shanghai Securities News*: Since the RMB exchange rate reform on July 21, 2005, the RMB has been in a continuous appreciation trend against the U.S. dollar. Analysts predict that the RMB will continue to appreciate in 2007 and may accelerate. The main reasons are:  \n  1. China’s international balance of payments surplus will continue to expand, and foreign exchange reserves will maintain rapid growth.  \n  2. The RMB appreciation rate against the U.S. dollar is slower than the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the British pound, indicating that the RMB still has significant appreciation potential.  \n  3. The victory of the Democratic Party in the U.S. elections may increase pressure for a rapid appreciation of the RMB.  \n\n- *Zhou Yu (2007)*: Examined the impact of changing times and environments on the RMB exchange rate mechanism. Amid numerous conflicting phenomena, events, and opinions, the author sought to explore the logic and driving forces behind changes in the RMB exchange rate and exchange rate mechanism.  \n\n- By 2008, the RMB/USD central parity rate was reported at 6.9408, rising slightly by 24 basis points compared to the previous trading day. Economist Jin Yanshi predicted that RMB appreciation would continue until the end of the following year. He also anticipated a shift from rapid to slower appreciation based on the economic trends of the United States. The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis began in 2007, led to a recession in 2008, and was expected to recover by 2009. As the U.S. dollar regained strength, it would influence the pace of RMB appreciation.  \n\n- *Liu Yuhui*, director of the China Economic Evaluation Center at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that the short-term slowdown in RMB appreciation in April of that year was mainly due to a temporary rebound in the U.S. dollar against other currencies. However, this did not indicate a fundamental improvement in the U.S. economy. Instead, it reflected weaker-than-expected economic conditions in the EU and Japan.  \n\n- Nobel laureate *Paul Krugman* wrote an article on March 14, 2010, titled *Taking On China*, arguing that the \"highly distorted\" RMB exchange rate was \"harming the world.\" He urged the U.S. government not to fear angering China and suggested imposing a 25% punitive tariff on Chinese imports if the RMB did not appreciate significantly.  \n\n### **III. Theoretical Overview of the Topic**  \n\nExchange rate fluctuations impact trade balance by affecting the prices and quantities of exported and imported goods. Early discussions on this topic date back to the **mercantilist school**, which viewed currency as the only wealth and advocated export incentives while restricting imports to accumulate monetary wealth. Mercantilists believed that devaluing a country’s currency in exchange transactions was beneficial because it made domestic goods cheaper for foreigners while making foreign goods more expensive domestically, thus increasing monetary inflows.  \n\nLater, economists such as **Marshall, Lerner, and Metzler** developed the **elasticity approach**, analyzing how changes in exchange rates alter the relative prices of traded goods and thus impact trade balance. This approach highlighted the necessary conditions for exchange rate adjustments to balance trade and incorporated the effects of trade terms.  \n\nMeanwhile, the **monetary approach** to balance of payments, based on general equilibrium analysis, emphasized the role of macroeconomic factors in responding to devaluation. It stated that trade balance results from the difference between national income and domestic absorption, with exchange rate fluctuations influencing trade by altering income and spending levels.  \n\nSince the 1970s, as most countries adopted floating exchange rate systems, new theories and methods have emerged to analyze the impact of exchange rate changes on trade balances. Economists have increasingly focused on the **long-term effects** of exchange rate fluctuations on international trade, using microeconomic analysis to study macroeconomic issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Presentation PPT Outline**  \n\n1. **Title Page**  \n   - Research title  \n   - Name and date  \n\n2. **Introduction**  \n   - Name and academic level  \n   - Advisor’s name and contact information  \n   - Research topic and objectives  \n   - Statement of research questions  \n   - Research significance and potential impact  \n\n3. **Literature Review**  \n   - Key findings from existing research  \n   - Current state and future trends in the field  \n   - Research gaps and unresolved issues  \n   - How this research addresses these gaps  \n\n4. **Research Methods**  \n   - Research design (experiment, survey, case study, etc.)  \n   - Data collection methods  \n   - Tools and techniques used  \n   - Data analysis approach  \n\n5. **Timeline and Expected Results**  \n   - Start and end dates of research  \n   - Key findings anticipated at different stages  \n   - Estimated completion date  \n\n6. **Conclusion and Outlook**  \n   - Summary of key points  \n   - Future research directions  \n   - Acknowledgments  \n   - References (if needed)", "checklist": [{"name": "Speech Structure and Alignment with PPT Framework", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response structures the opening defense speech according to the provided PPT outline, with appropriate content for each section and seamless transitions between slides.", "1-2": "Speech completely ignores the provided PPT framework with no discernible structure or slide organization.

{"index": 35, "domain1": "Academic & Engineering", "domain2": "Defense Script", "query": "我是历史专业研究生，请给我的毕业论文撰写一份10分钟左右的毕业答辩稿。并给我几个答辩现场可能的提问和对应的解答。\n需要参考的毕业论文：\n中国共产党话语体系中“第三世界”概念的发展演变与历史意义 \n党的二十届三中全会强调：“中国式现代化是走和平发展道路的现代化。必须坚定奉行独立 自主的和平外交政策，推动构建人类命运共同体，践行全人类共同价值。” [1]从概念所指分析， “构建人类命运共同体”是中国共产党外交官方话语，是应对全球性挑战的中国答案，其核心要 义是各国共同携手、开创美好未来。而“人类命运共同体”是在中国共产党“第三世界”概念的基 础上发展、演变而来的。“第三世界”指的是发展中国家和地区，这一概念的生成和形塑经历了 较长时期，从“民族主义国家”“第一个中间地带”“第一个第三世界”“第三世界”到“第三世界发展 中国家”“亚太第三世界国家”“第三世界不发达国家”“南方国家”再到“亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲广 大发展中国家”“发展中国家”“全球南方”等话语表述的变化，深化和拓展了中国共产党“第三世 界”概念的话语内核和意义所指。系统考察中国共产党“第三世界”概念为何产生、从何而来、如 何发展，能为揭示中国共产党构建国际统一战线的理论与实践提供隐喻线索，为弘扬全人类共 同价值、推动构建人类命运共同体提供历史参照。 一、中国共产党“第三世界”概念的孕育 中国共产党关于“第三世界”的概念是在“两个阵营，三种力量”思想中孕育产生的，是基于 中国共产党对国际形势的科学研判。据考证，在《汉语大词典》中，“世界”一词在意涵上或指 昆明理工大学学报（社会科学版） 3 自然界和人类社会活动的总和，或指地球上所有地方、全球各国；通俗上指世上和人间[2]。马 克思指出：“哲学家们只是用不同的方式解释世界，问题在于改变世界。” [3]这里的“世界”指人 的现实世界，或者说是人的实践生活。在近代中国，“世界”一词广泛使用，有学者对近代以来 不同时期“世界”的主要用法进行了分析，发现“世界”一词多用于指称地球上所有地方、全球各 国[4]。其中，最为熟悉的莫过于“开眼看世界”的表述，这里的“世界”指当时所有的国家和地区。 总的来看，“世界”一词最具普遍的意涵是指地球上所有国家。加之“第三”一词是一个序数词， 因此，从词源上对“第三世界”进行语义溯源，并非普遍意义上的“第三世界”概念内涵，但在一 定程度上都具有指称国家或地区的意涵。 对中国共产党“第三世界”概念的考察要追溯到毛泽东“中间地带”概念的提出。早在 1946 年 8 月 6 日，毛泽东与美国记者斯特朗谈到国际形势时指出：“美国和苏联中间隔着极其辽阔的地 带，这里有欧、亚、非三洲的许多资本主义国家和殖民地、半殖民地国家。” [5]其中就蕴含着“中 间地带”思想。同年 12 月 9 日，毛泽东在王家坪会见西方记者时，首次提出“中间地带”表述：“现 在美国反苏是放烟幕弹，想独霸世界，首先就是损害中国和英国的利益，其次就是美苏间的中 间地带。” [6]可以看出，在毛泽东当时的战略划分思想中，他就已经把包含亚非国家的“中间地 带”作为区别于美国和苏联的第三方了。因此，毛泽东在此提出的“中间地带”概念，无论是从涉 及的范畴，抑或是其在当时世界格局中的第三方地位来看，一定程度上就是中国共产党“第三世 界”概念的最初源头。 中华人民共和国成立初期，国际政治形势正处于美苏争霸的两极格局中，第三世界还没有 完全兴起，还未与其他两个世界形成对应的独立“世界”，但在矛盾对立上已有一定的端倪。中 国共产党在毛泽东“中间地带”理论的指导下，结合国际国内形势，做出了当下时代主题是“战争 与革命”的判断，将外交重点放在反对帝国主义霸权和促进亚非国家团结合作上，对亚非发展中 国家摆脱殖民主义统治，争取独立的民族解放运动给予了极大的关注和支持，在此过程中对“第 三世界”的特点也有了更加清晰的认识。20 世纪 50 年代初期，毛泽东、周恩来、陈毅等中国共 产党人敏锐察觉到，第一次没有西方殖民主义者参加的万隆会议是打开中国与亚非国家关系、 打破西方国家外交封锁的契机，因而十分重视万隆会议。“近代以来，亚非两洲的大多数国家在 不同程度上遭受了殖民主义的掠夺和压迫，以致被迫处于贫困和落后的停滞状态。现在亚非地 区的面貌已经发生了巨大的变化。越来越多的亚非国家摆脱了或正在摆脱着殖民主义的束缚。 虽然如此，殖民主义在这个地区的统治并没有结束，而且新的殖民主义者正在谋取旧的殖民主 义者的地位而代之。这样，保障世界和平、争取和维护民族独立并为此目的而促进各国间的友 好合作就不能不是亚非各国人民的共同愿望。” [7]465-466 周恩来的这一论述，概括了亚非国家的 历史遭遇、现实境遇和共同目标，指出了亚非国家的共同特点，蕴含着代表发展中国家这一群 体的“第三世界”概念意涵。总的来说，万隆会议的成功召开，团结了亚非的发展中国家，是第 三世界崛起的重要标志之一。正如廖承志所说：“万隆会议的胜利是第三世界开始兴起时对帝国 主义、殖民主义斗争第一回合的胜利，是五项原则的胜利，是亚非人民的胜利，是革命外交路 线的胜利。” [8]由此可知，中国共产党“第三世界”概念酝酿于中华人民共和国成立后中国共产党 对国际形势的科学研判。 20 世纪 50 年代中后期，许多发展中国家开始摆脱殖民主义统治，掀起了争取独立的民族 解放运动。随着亚非等地区先后出现了多个独立国家，具有“第三世界”概念意涵的“民族主义国 家”表述应运而生。早在 1956 年 12 月 19 日，周恩来在与吴巴瑞就国际形势交换意见时指出：“目 前世界上有三类国家，帝国主义国家、社会主义国家和民族主义国家。” [7]648 随后，他在国务 昆明理工大学学报（社会科学版） 4 院第五十二次全体会议上又提到了“亚非民族主义国家” [9]84-85。由此可知，周恩来在此提出的“民 族主义国家”指的主要是亚洲和非洲地区的发展中国家。随着中国共产党人对国际形势认识的变 化，“民族主义国家”概念指称的国家范围从亚非发展中国家扩大到亚非拉发展中国家。1958 年 9 月 2 日，毛泽东在会见巴西记者马罗金和杜特列夫人时讲道：“事实上，这种观点只适合于一 部分国家，对于印度、印度尼西亚、阿拉伯联合共和国等国家却不适用。它们不是帝国主义国 家，也不是社会主义国家，而是民族主义国家。拉丁美洲也有许多这样的国家，将来还会 多。” [10]431-432 毛泽东进一步把拉丁美洲也纳入民族主义国家范畴了。至此，在中国共产党的话 语表达中，“民族主义国家”概念主要是指既不属于社会主义国家也不属于帝国主义国家的亚洲、 非洲和拉丁美洲，这其实正是 20 世纪 50 年代中国共产党“两个阵营，三种力量” ① 思想的体现。 中国共产党对“民族主义国家”的外交政策，主要在于争取。正如周恩来在不同场合提及的：“争 取民族主义国家” [9]6“对社会主义国家要求同存异，对民族主义国家要扩大争取面，以孤立美帝 国主义” [9]36“对民族主义国家以争取为主，达到联合他们反对帝国主义，这就是统一战线” [9]188 等。可见，当时中国共产党在构建国际统一战线时，除了坚持对社会主义国家要求同存异的“一 边倒”政策外，还致力于争取亚非拉民族主义国家以共同反对帝国主义。 二、中国共产党“第三世界”概念的生成 中国共产党“第三世界”概念在毛泽东“中间地带”理论发展到“两个中间地带”理论的过程中 不断生成。20 世纪 50 年代中期，中苏关系的破裂使社会主义阵营走向瓦解，动荡的国际局势 使中国共产党重新思考国际统一战线的对象，在此背景下毛泽东提出了“中间地带”理论。1956 年 10 月 19 日，毛泽东在会见巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底时，正式提出了“中间地带”理论，他讲道： “中间地带从英国一直到拉丁美洲。这个地带有最多的人口，最多的国家。这个地带包括三种性 质的国家。第一类是拥有殖民地的帝国主义国家，如英国、法国；第二类是亚洲、非洲、拉丁 美洲的国家，有的已经取得民族解放，有的正在争取民族解放，像你们就属于第二类国家；第 三类是在欧洲的不拥有殖民地的自由国家。” [10]12-13 不难看出，“中间地带”概念所指涉的范围包 括亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲这些第三世界国家，换言之，这时真正意义上的“第三世界”与“中间地 带”是从属关系，即“第三世界”属于“中间地带”。同年 12 月 27 日，陈毅在《关于目前国家形势 的一些看法》的报告中还提出了要“争取中间地带”。对此，结合毛泽东在 1957 年提出的“两类 矛盾，三种力量” ② 观点，可以看出，中国共产党已较为充分地认识到被压迫的亚非拉民族将成 为一支独立的政治力量，并把“中间地带”国家作为了国际统一战线的争取对象。 随着国际形势的变化，毛泽东“中间地带”理论进一步发展为“两个中间地带”理论，用以指 称亚非拉国家的“第一个中间地带”表述也随之而出。1963 年 9 月 27 日，毛泽东在中共中央工 作会议上第一次提出“两个中间地带”论断：“我看中间地带有两个，一个是亚、非、拉，一个是 欧洲。” [11]262 随后，毛泽东还为两个中间地带排了序，指出：“亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲是第一个 中间地带，欧洲、加拿大、澳洲、日本是第二个中间地带。” [11]363-364 与之类似的是，1964 年 8 ① 注：“两个阵营，三种力量”，指的是自第二次世界大战以来，整个世界分成资本主义和社会主义两个阵营， 同时存在三种力量，即社会主义的力量、帝国主义的力量和民族主义的力量。 ② 注：1957 年 1 月 27 日，毛泽东在谈及苏伊士运河事件时，提出了“两类矛盾，三种力量“观点。两类矛盾： 一类是帝国主义跟帝国主义之间的矛盾，即美国跟英国、美国跟法国之间的矛盾，一类是帝国主义跟被压迫 民族之间的矛盾。三种力量：第一种是最大的帝国主义美国，第二种是二等帝国主义英、法，第三种就是被 压迫民族。 昆明理工大学学报（社会科学版） 5 月 17 日，毛泽东在与阿尔及利亚驻中国大使穆罕默德·亚拉的谈话时，还提出了“两个第三世界” 说，他讲道：“我们把中间世界分为两部分。中间世界即所谓第三世界。第一个第三世界是亚洲、 非洲、拉丁美洲。第二个第三世界包括像法国、日本、加拿大以及欧洲其他一些国家。” [11]386 通过对比，不难看出，“两个第三世界”说和“两个中间地带”论断的内容基本一样，其中的“中间 世界”无异于“中间地带”，都等同“第三世界”。换言之，“第一个中间地带”表述在意涵上等同于 “第一个第三世界”表述，都指称亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家。但也可以看出，毛泽东对“第三世 界”概念还处于思考中。自此之后，“第一个中间地带”和“第一个第三世界”表述成为中国共产党 话语表达中指称亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的代名词。 值得一提的是，1972 年 9 月 17 日，在与赞比亚副总统乔纳及所率赞友好代表团会谈时， 周恩来讲道：“社会主义国家、帝国主义国家和第三世界都不是铁板一块。” [12]对比 1956 年周 恩来提到的：“目前世界上有三类国家，帝国主义国家、社会主义国家和民族主义国家” [7]648， 能够明显看出，中国共产党从“民族主义国家”到“第三世界”的话语演变。但其中不变的是，中 国共产党仍是以意识形态作为划分世界的标准，对于三个世界的概念仍是初期的认识，即“第一 世界是以美国为首的旧的帝国主义阵营，第二世界是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，第三世界是 争取和维护民族独立的国家” [13]。 中国共产党“第三世界”概念最终确立是在 20 世纪 70 年代。1973 年 3 月 26 日，毛泽东在 会见喀麦隆总统阿希乔时才对“第三世界”概念作出明确界定，他讲道：“亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲 都叫第三世界，但是日本除外。” [14]从目前掌握的资料来看，这是中国共产党最早对“第三世界” 概念内涵做出明确界定，且不同于“民族主义国家”“第一个中间地带”“第一个第三世界”表述所 指称的范围，为了避免误会，在“亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲”表述后着重强调了“日本除外”，而这 一变化正是中国共产党对国际形势认识进一步深化的体现。随后，1974 年 2 月 22 日，毛泽东 在会见赞比亚总统卡翁达时，首次提出的“三个世界划分”理论① 更是再一次完整准确界定了“第 三世界”概念的指称范围，并提出了与“第三世界”概念相对应的“第一世界”和“第二世界”概念。 从这也可以看出，这时中国共产党划分世界的标准已不同于初期，已从意识形态转为以经济和 军事实力作为划分标准了。同年 4 月 10 日，邓小平在联合国大会第六届特别会议上向全世界提 出中国共产党“第三世界”概念，他讲道：“亚非拉发展中国家和其他地区的发展中国家，是第三 世界。” [15]至此，这是中国共产党对“第三世界”概念作出的最为正式的界定。同时，邓小平也 郑重地向世界宣称：“中国是一个社会主义国家，也是一个发展中的国家，中国属于第三世 界” [16]355，向世界表明了“中国属于第三世界”的国际定位。10 月 15 日，邓小平在讲话中还指出： “第三世界就是被帝国主义、殖民主义掠夺、压迫和欺负的国家。它们要摆脱自己被剥削、被压 迫、被欺负的状态，要控制自己的资源，不但要争取政治上的独立，而且要争取经济上的独 立。” [16]388 实际上，这就正式阐明了“第三世界”的特点和共同任务。相应地，20 世纪 70 年代， 以毛泽东同志为主要代表的中国共产党人对外主张“一条线” ② 的外交战略，致力于联合一切可以 联合的力量以构建反苏联霸权主义的统一战线。 ① 1974 年毛泽东在会见赞比亚总统卡翁达时，首次提出“三个世界划分”理论：“美国、苏联是第一世界。 中间派，日本、欧洲、澳大利亚、加拿大是第二世界。咱们是第三世界。美国、苏联原子弹多，也比较富。 第二世界，欧洲、日本、澳大利亚、加拿大，原子弹没有那么多，也没有那么富，但是比较第三世界要富。 第三世界人口很多。亚洲除了日本，都是第三世界。整个非洲都是第三世界，拉丁美洲也是第三世界。” ② 注：“一条线”外交战略指的是 20 世纪 70 年代中国针对苏联霸权主义的威胁，提出从东边起，日本、 中国、欧洲、美国，加上同一条线上的第三世界各国，联合努力，共同对付苏联霸权主义的思想。 昆明理工大学学报（社会科学版） 6 综上，这一时期，“第三世界”概念历经“第一个中间地带”“第一个第三世界”到“第三世界” 的话语演变，呈现出了“第三世界”概念的核心范畴和演进逻辑，其特点和共同任务在中国共产 党的话语建构下也进一步明确。同时还生动呈现了中国共产党从“争取中间地带”到“一条线”的 国际统一战线思想不断完善发展的过程。 三、中国共产党“第三世界”概念的发展 自 1973 年毛泽东首次对“第三世界”概念作出界定后，中国共产党一直在发展完善这一概 念，而且在表述上也不断发生着变化。在此期间，以邓小平同志为核心的党中央对国际形势和 世界发展深入观察和思考，逐渐改变对时代主题的判断，并在 1985 年正式提出“和平和发展是 当代世界两大主题” [17]1031；同时，中国共产党人对时代主题认识的转变也成为“第三世界”概念 发展的转折点。此后，中国共产党的话语表达中出现了“第三世界”概念使用频率减少、“发展中 国家”概念使用频率增加的现象。在新时代，面对世界百年未有之大变局，中国共产党逐渐认识 到推动“南南合作”的必要性和重要意义，开始用“全球南方”概念来指称发展中国家。 进入 20 世纪 80 年代不久，“第三世界”概念表述已经有所变化。1982 年 3 月 25 日，邓小 平在会见巴西外交部部长拉米罗·萨赖瓦·格雷罗时提的是“第三世界发展中国家”：“现在第三世 界发展中国家都有些彼此可以借鉴的东西，这与过去有很大的不同。” [17]806 同年 11 月 20 日， 邓小平在一次讲话中提的是“亚太第三世界国家”表述：“我们不但现在，以后也坚持同亚太第三 世界国家加强合作，共同对付超级大国的挑战。” [18]1984 年 10 月 23 日，在与突尼斯总理穆罕 默德·姆扎利会谈时，邓小平又使用了“第三世界不发达国家”表述：“联合国安理会常任理事国， 中国算一个。中国这一票是第三世界的，是名副其实地属于第三世界不发达国家的。” [17]1009-1010 同年 12 月 13 日，邓小平与苏丹总统加法尔·穆罕默德惠·尼迈里谈到南北问题时用的是“南方国 家”表述：“南北问题对第三世界国家是个非常现实的问题，南方国家首先要摆脱贫困。” [17]1018 此处“南方国家”表述则主要是为了对应北方的发达国家。显然，以上“第三世界”概念的不同表 述都与发展问题有着极大关联。这不难理解，第三世界国家在取得政治上的独立后，需要通过 经济发展来巩固政治独立。正如十二大党代会政治报告所强调的：“第三世界各国面临的共同任 务首先是维护民族独立和国家主权，积极发展民族经济，以经济独立来巩固已经取得的政治独 立。” [19]44 相应地，在上述表述中能够明显看出中国共产党对同第三世界国家加强经济合作的 重视，由此也出现了“南南合作” ① 的新提法。对此，早在 1982 年 7 月 12 日，邓小平在与几内亚 外交部部长阿卜杜拉耶·杜尔的会谈中就强调：“第三世界国家之间要加强联合和团结，南南合 作是第三世界国家之间加强联合促进发展的一个重要方式，中国很重视南南合作。” [17]830 总体 来看，虽然这一时期“第三世界”概念在其表述上不断发生变化，但中国共产党始终用“第三世界” 概念指称发展中国家这一群体。当然，在这些不同表述的背后，可以看到中国共产党从注重联 合第三世界反对霸权主义向团结第三世界发展经济的转变趋势。 概念使用的适配性取决于其所处的政治语境。20 世纪 80 年代中后期，中国共产党在话语 表达中逐渐用更具发展性的“发展中国家”概念取代更具政治性的“第三世界”概念。党的十三大 将其正式概括为“和平与发展是当代世界的主题”。时代主题是制定内外政策的基础和依据，这 ① 注：南南合作，指发展中国家之间的经济合作。由于发展中国家多数位于发达国家的南方，因此人们 习惯把发展中国家之间的经济合作称为南南合作。 昆明理工大学学报（社会科学版） 7 一时期，以邓小平同志为主要代表的中国共产党人将和平与发展的问题和反对霸权主义、维护 世界和平联系起来，对内把发展问题提到重要位置，对外坚持独立自主的和平外交政策。在此 背景下，中国共产党在话语表达上有意识地将“发展中国家”概念与“第三世界”概念混合使用， “亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲广大发展中国家” [20]194“同广大发展中国家加强团结合作” [20]741 等表述频 繁出现。据统计，自党的十三大政治报告开始，“发展中国家”表述出现的频率一直高于“第三世 界”概念，尤其是十四大政治报告中，“发展中国家”概念出现频率达 7 次之高，而“第三世界” 概念仅出现了 1 次。随后的十五大和十六大政治报告中，“第三世界”概念均只出现了一次，且 自十七大政治报告开始，“第三世界”概念已不再出现在党代会政治报告中。此外，中国共产党 的重要文献也极少使用“第三世界”概念，只在纪念邓小平的讲话中出现，其他场合多是使用“发 展中国家”表述。在《习近平谈治国理政》第一~四卷中，“发展中国家”概念分别出现了 18 次、 47 次、41 次、63 次，而“第三世界”概念仅出现了 3 次[21]。值得一提的是，在中国共产党的话 语表达中，“加强同第三世界国家的团结和合作，是我国外交工作的基本立足点” [19]352“中国永 远站在第三世界一边” [17]829 等以“第三世界”为核心的外交话语，也逐渐转变为“加强同广大发展 中国家的团结合作，是中国外交的基本立足点。中国始终是发展中国家的好朋友、好伙伴，将 永远站在发展中国家一边” [22]。可见，在中国共产党的话语表达中，“发展中国家”概念逐渐代 替“第三世界”概念。 百年未有之大变局下，“第三世界”概念得到进一步发展和延续，中国共产党逐渐用“全球南 方”概念来指称发展中国家。2023 年 7 月 25 日，王毅在第十三次金砖国家安全事务高级代表会 议上指出：“全球南方是新兴市场国家和发展中国家的集合体，体现了我们在国际舞台上的群体 性崛起。” [23]相较于“第三世界”“发展中国家”概念，中国共产党对“全球南方”概念所指称范畴的 界定除了发展中国家外还多了新兴市场国家这一对象。这其实正是中国共产党对当下国际形势 认识的反映，随着经济全球化和世界政治多极化趋势的加快，发展中国家快速发展起来，一大 批新兴经济体也不断崛起，这一群体性的崛起对世界版图有着重大的影响，也引起国际社会的 极大关注和高度重视。对此，中国共产党一如既往坚持中国同发展中国家是命运共同体的立场。 2023 年 8 月 22 日,习近平主席在金砖国家工商论坛闭幕式发表致辞时强调：“作为发展中国家、 ‘全球南方’的一员，中国始终同其他发展中国家同呼吸、共命运，坚定维护发展中国家共同利 益，推动增加新兴市场国家和发展中国家在全球事务中的代表性和发言权。” [24]这一表述向世 界表明了中国始终是发展中国家、‘全球南方’一员的国际定位，仍将致力于推动“南南合作”， 谋求共同发展进步，充分展现了中国与发展中国家间交往的理念与价值选择。习近平总书记称 “金砖合作机制是当今世界最重要的新兴市场国家和发展中国家团结合作平台” [25]，并在多个外 交场合强调要建设“和平金砖”“创新金砖”“绿色金砖”“公正金砖”“人文金砖”，表示“中方愿同金 砖各国一道，开创‘大金砖合作’高质量发展新局面，携手更多‘全球南方’国家共同推动构建人类 命运共同体” [26]由此可见，无论国际形势如何变化，中国共产党始终如一地坚持与“全球南方” 加强团结合作，维护共同利益，推动构建人类命运共同体的外交理念。 四、中国共产党“第三世界”概念的影响 新时代，中国共产党官方话语较少出现“第三世界”，但“亚非拉”“南南合作”等话语与“第三 世界”概念仍有较大关联。20 世纪 70 年代至 90 年代，中国共产党“第三世界”概念的提出与演 变，对中国的外交政策、世界政治经济局势都有重大意义。 昆明理工大学学报（社会科学版） 8 首先，“第三世界”概念明确了中华人民共和国成立后我国外交的总体思路，彰显了中国的 和平共处五项原则，扩大了中国在第三世界的影响。一方面，“第三世界”概念的提出，使中国 在急剧变动的两极争霸格局下明确自己“属于第三世界”的国际定位。1974 年，邓小平在联合国 大会上向世界宣布：“中国是一个社会主义国家，也是一个发展中的国家，中国属于第三世 界。” [16]355 这引起了第三世界国家的热烈反响，很多第三世界国家希望中国可以做第三世界的 领导者。对此，邓小平在一次会谈中指出：“现在中国落后，没有资格称霸，以后中国发展起来 了，也不称霸。所以，我们把永远不称霸作为我们国家的指导原则。” [27]邓小平的回应，不仅 重申了中国属于第三世界的定位，还表明了中国重视发展同第三世界国家的平等友好关系，及 中国永不称霸的决心。另一方面，20 世纪七八十年代，中国共产党建构了围绕“第三世界”的外 交话语，其中包括“加强同第三世界国家的团结和合作，是我国外交工作的基本立足点” [19]352“中 国永远属于第三世界，同第三世界国家坚定地站在一起” [28]“支援第三世界各国人民保卫民族独 立、发展民族经济和反对帝国主义、霸权主义、殖民主义的正义斗争，是我们不可推卸的国际 义务” [29]等，既展现了中国对第三世界国家的支持和重视，还体现了中国对和平共处五项原则 的坚持。当然，中国共产党也赢得了广大第三世界国家的信任和赞扬。例如，1974 年 5 月 14 日，巴基斯坦布托总理在讲话中表示：“副总理先生，我受巴基斯坦全体人民之命到中国来亲自 向这个伟大国家的领导人和人民表示感谢，感谢他们在巴基斯坦历史上的最黑暗的日子里给予 我们的坚定不移的支持。中国坚持国际关系中的公认的正义的原则，不仅对南亚地区的局势正 常化，而且也对于整个世界和平作出了极其重要的贡献。” [30]这意味着此时的中国与第三世界 国家已经成为相互依存的命运共同体。 其次，“第三世界”概念凝聚了发展中国家群体的力量，促进了第三世界国家的发展，推动 了世界共同进步。“第三世界”概念是在“三个世界划分”理论的整体框架下提出的，是独立于“第 一世界”和“第二世界”存在的，三者是并列关系，这一提法强调了第三世界作为独立国家在世界 政治舞台上的重要地位，使发展中国家得以汇集在第三世界旗帜下，对外奉行和平、中立、不 结盟的政策，而不是依赖于某个集团或某个国家。在此环境下，第三世界国家意识到在争取并 巩固民族政治独立的基础上，可以通过团结斗争促进本国发展。于是，第三世界国家在经济、 政治、文化、科技等领域成立了很多组织机构。例如：1976 年成立的致力于研究第三世界国家 面临的经济、社会问题，探讨适合这些国家和地区发展的途径的“墨西哥第三世界经济社会研究 中心” [31]；1978 年 3 月建立的以“加速第三世界文化、社会和经济的发展，协助第三世界国家同 发达国家建立公正与平等关系，呼吁人们关心第三世界人民的贫困状况” [32]为主要宗旨的“第三 世界社会经济研究基金会”；1983 年 11 月在意大利的里雅斯特成立的致力于促进第三世界各国 科学研究发展的“第三世界科学院” [33]等。在这些组织机构的共同努力下，第三世界国家的力量 逐渐强大起来，在国际事务中发挥了越来越重要的作用，逐渐成为反对霸权主义斗争的主力军， 也使整个世界发生了有利于人类进步事业的深刻变化。 最后，“第三世界”概念有力回应了霸权主义和强权政治，推动了国际统一战线的建立，对 维护世界和平有重要影响。中国共产党“第三世界”概念是伴随着毛泽东“三个世界划分”理论的 形成出现的。“三个世界划分”理论回答了关于国际阶级斗争的重要问题，即谁是我们的朋友， 谁是我们的敌人，指明了要建立以第三世界国家为主力军，联合第二世界国家，反对超级大国 的国际统一战线。20 世纪 70 年代，世界处于美苏争霸两极格局下，超级大国的霸权主义和可 能存在的战争威胁着世界各国人民的生活。在“三个世界划分”理论的指导下，第二世界同第三 世界之间对话不断增加；同时，第三世界国家也团结起来，展开了维护民族独立、捍卫国家主 昆明理工大学学报（社会科学版） 9 权，反对帝国主义掠夺、剥削和控制的斗争。例如：东南亚国家的代表在一系列国际会议上， 同第三世界其他国家一起，声讨超级大国对发展中国家的掠夺和剥削，谴责超级大国推行霸权 主义和强权政治 [34]；20 世纪 80 年代末，在以第三世界各国人民为主力军的全世界人民的共同 努力下，建立了广泛的国际统一战线，有效避免了第三次世界大战的爆发，维护了世界和平。 五、结语 总的来看，“第三世界”概念的发展演变蕴含着中国共产党推动构建人类命运共同体的演进 逻辑，可以说，“第三世界”概念是全人类共同价值形成的雏形。70 年前，面对冷战的分裂对峙， 中国共产党人在和平共处五项原则的指导下，提出了以“第三世界”概念为核心的团结发展中国 家的外交理论；70 年后的今天，面对“建设一个什么样的世界、如何建设这个世界”的重大课题， 中国又给出了构建人类命运共同体这个时代答案[35]。因此，新时代，在中国是“全球南方”一员 的国际定位下，致力于关照发展中国家和新兴市场国家、体现中国“永不称霸”立场、引领国际 秩序重塑的人类命运共同体是中国共产党国际统一战线的新篇章，中国共产党要一如既往加强 同发展中国家和“全球南方”的团结合作，推动“大金砖合作”行稳致远，坚守全人类共同价值， 为世界和平与发展作出新的重大贡献。", "checklist": [{"name": "Content Comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how

Key words：Industrial Internet of Things ; data security ; blockchain ; zero-knowledge proof 0 引言 工业物联网(Industrial Internet of Things, IIoT)是指在工业中使用物联网技术来提高工业流程的生产力和效率。通过工业传感器进行数据收集、机器协调、软硬件监控和维护、质量控制、供应链可追溯性、能源管理和总体成本降低等方法来帮助工业发展，实时数据收集、处理和决策能力重新定义行业标准。随着工业物联网中服务器与传感器的数量越来越多，产生的数据字段和链路传输不断增加，随之而来的，数据丢失和泄露的风险呈指数级增长。因此，数据完整性和数据安全性成为工业物联网中至关重要的方面。 数据完整性是指数据在其生命周期内的准确性、可靠性和一致性，用以确保数据免受未经授权的访问和修改，对数据存储、数据流和数据管理非常重要，使得数据准确可靠。数据安全性是指保护数据免受安全漏洞的侵害，涉及免受未经授权的访问、窃取和篡改数据的措施，确保敏感信息的机密性和隐私性。数据泄露会造成财务损失、声誉受损和法律责任等严重后果。在数据存储、数据流和数据管理方面，数据安全措施包括加密、访问控制、日志备份、审计跟踪和恢复程序等。因此，如何采取强有力的措施来保护其数据至关重要[1]。 区块链是一种去中心化的点对点系统和分布式不可变账本[2]。它提供了一种高效、透明的机制来分析和控制数据，能够确保数据的完整性、透明度和可信度，是保护敏感工业数据的理想选择。在区块链机制下，将不同传感器节点运行产生的数据进行共享，并确保所有数据彼此相同。由于数据存储在各种传感器节点上，并且所有数据(区块)都与前一个区块相链接，因此运行在区块链中的数据极难被删除或篡改，区块链有助于安全地存储和验证敏感信息，从而有效地维护工业物联网络中彼此间数据传输的信任[3]。 本文通过引用区块链技术增强工业物联网数据的完整性和安全性方法，使用私有区块链网关来保护从工业传感器节点到核心处理单元的数据流，并集成零知识证明加密技术来验证数据并限制对授权实体的访问。 1 相关工作 针对工业物联网中数据完整性与安全性的进展和挑战，将区块链技术融入工业物联网，本节将探索工业物联网与区块链相融合的相关研究背景。

本节概述了基于区块链技术的工业物联网数据安全框架。通过将区块链技术集成在工业物联网中，收集传感器设备数据，构建控制系统和数据共享系统，以应对分散信息流通、内部信息控制访问和隐私方面的挑战。将各个实体之间共享数据传输到私有区块链网关，通过区块链数据共享机制对每一个存储区块进行跟踪分析，以零知识证明方法解密数据，引入新的存储位置来更新区块链，通过共识机制对数据进行验证和认证，确保记录在区块链上数据的完整性和安全性，如图1所示。 图1基于区块链技术的工业物联网数据安全框架  2.1 传感器节点 工业物联网中包含大量种类繁多的传感器节点，不同传感器收集的数据类型也不同。针对具有计算能力的传感器节点，通过数据过滤和阈值检测等本地数据预处理操作，使传感器能够仅发送相关信息，从而减少传输的数据量。此外，对于无法进行计算的传感器，可以使用协作处理技术，通过传感器多跳协同工作将任务传输到邻近的基站或云服务。通过这些方法，使传感器节点能够提升工业物联网生态系统的整体效率和响应能力。 2.2 区块链 区块链技术的去中心化特性在工业物联网中至关重要，用来保证数据的完整性、安全性和信任的关键层。对比传统的集中式架构，区块链提供了工业物联网传感器设备之间数据交易的防篡改记录，消除对中央权威机构的需求，使系统具有抵抗单点故障的能力。本文利用私有区块链，传感器节点间的每次传输记录多个节点验证，且访问仅限于授权节点，确保数据交换的透明度和可信度。私有区块链作为工业物联网设备和网络之间安全数据传输的支柱，有效减少了计算负荷和能耗，使工业物联网最大化资源使用率。 2.3 证书颁发机构 证书颁发机构(CA)在工业物联网数据传输过程中对证书缓存起着战略性作用，其中服务器可以存储和重复使用以前获得的证书，而不是反复请求新证书。这种方法对数据结构一致的或重复的数据模式，可显著减少响应延迟并提高传输速度。 2.4 零知识证明 零知识证明(ZKP)是一种加密技术，允许互不信任的通信双方之间证明某个命题的有效性，同时不泄露任何额外信息。在基于区块链技术的去中心化工业物联网中，通过零知识证明可以减少重复生成证明或验证相同证明的计算开销，从而缩短数据传输时间并优化资源利用率，同时保障数据隐私性和安全性。 2.5 PoA共识 权威证明(PoA)是一种基于权威性的共识算法，通过由特定的授权节点验证交易并打包区块的方式来达成共识。PoA共识机制中的授权节点由网络中的信任实体担任，这些实体通常是经过认证的组织或个人。相比于其他共识机制，PoA在防止双重支付和恶意行为方面具有更高的安全性。 3 基于区块链技术的工业物联网数据安全实现过程 本节描述了区块链技术的工业物联网数据安全实现过程，旨在将物联网设备与私有区块链网络无缝集成，如图2所示。该过程分为4个不同阶段，利用零知识证明加密技术来确保数据完整性、安全性和高效处理。 图2基于区块链技术的工业物联网数据安全实现过程  3.1 传感器节点到私有区块链网关 第1阶段为数据收集和预处理过程。通过传感器节点收集数据，采取预处理和加密等一系列步骤准备这些数据，将数据安全高效地传输到私有区块链网关。 3.1.1 数据收集 收集在工业物联网环境中部署的大量传感节点原始数据。为了优化存储和传输，对原始数据进行调整来优化信息收集处理，为安全简化地传输到本地服务器做好准备。 3.1.2 数据传输到本地服务器 本地服务器作为下行传感器节点的中间收集点，从多个传感器节点收集数据。其目的是简化数据流，为进一步处理和最终传输到区块链网关做好准备。 3.1.3 带缓存的证书请求 本地服务器从CA请求批量证书来验证数据，将证书缓存起来，以加快重复数据传输的速度。这种缓存机制可以有效减少频繁的CA验证，提高工作效率，并优化数据传输过程。 3.1.4 数据加密 本地服务器在接收并汇总下行传感节点的数据后，使用零知识证明加密算法来保护收集的数据。这种加密方式确保数据在传输到私有区块链网关过程中的安全性和防篡改性。 3.1.5 分布式并行处理 工业物联网上的分布式节点协作验证与数据相关的批次证书。通过利用并行处理，使得传感器节点可以有效地验证数据的来源和完整性，确保只有真实且未篡改的数据才能进入下一阶段。 3.2 私有区块链网关处理 第2阶段，私有区块链网关作为中心枢纽，在整个区块链网络中进行数据解密和智能分发的过程。其作用是安全解密数据，并智能地将其分发到区块链网络上，将数据引入新的存储位置来更新区块链。 3.2.1 数据解密 私有区块链网关在接收到传输的数据后，会启动解密过程。通过相应的解密密钥，确保数据在传输过程中的安全性，且仅网络内的授权实体能够访问这些数据。 3.2.2 智能分片和自适应速率限制 私有区块链网关采用智能分片技术，将解压后的数据高效地分配到各个区块链的分段或分片中。这种动态分配确保了数据存储和检索的最佳效果。同时，系统还设置了自适应速率限制机制，以监控和控制数据的处理速度。通过评估当前的网络负载并相应调整数据处理速率，系统确保了操作的顺畅进行，不会使网络或区块链过载。 3.2.3 数据分类 私有区块链网关根据数据的保密级别进行分类。通过数据分类分级规则标准，将数据分为“一般数据”和“核心数据”2类，一般数据存储在更易访问的位置，核心数据则需要遵循更严格的存储和访问协议。 分类决定后续的存储和处理流程，对这些数据应用最佳的哈希技术，生成唯一的数字签名或哈希值，确保数据的完整性和需要时的快速检索。对于访问控制，采用零知识证明方法允许在不透露敏感信息的情况下验证访问权限。区块链技术在此过程中发挥着关键作用，提供所有数据交易、访问请求和数据存储变化的透明且不可篡改的记录，从而促进审计和数据治理标准的合规性。 3.3 共识机制 第3阶段是基于区块链技术的工业物联网数据安全过程的关键，重点关注验证和认证数据的共识机制。验证节点通过彼此协作达成共识，实施权威证明机制进行可靠验证以及最终区块创建的过程，从而巩固数据在区块链账本中的地位，此阶段对于确保区块链上记录的数据的完整性和可信度至关重要。 3.3.1 分布式验证 通过分散在工业物联网上的多个验证节点协同参与验证数据真实性的过程，采用去中心化的验证方法，提高对单点故障或恶意攻击的抵抗力。每个节点独立验证数据及其相关元数据。当大多数节点就数据的真实性达成共识时，数据即被视为已验证。这种分布式验证可确保验证过程稳健可靠，从而增强系统的整体安全性和完整性。 3.3.2 数据真实性校验 以集体共识机制来验证节点协作确定数据的真实性，分布式节点各自完成独立验证后，协同其结果以达成共同协议。如果多数节点一致认为数据真实且未被篡改，则批准进一步处理。这种集体决策过程确保了数据的完整性，保护系统免受潜在的数据泄露或恶意篡改的威胁。 3.3.3 权威证明(PoA)共识 在PoA共识机制中，将选举出一组受信任的验证者来创建新区块并验证交易。与工作量证明(PoW)或权益证明(PoS)不同，PoA依赖于这些验证者的信誉，使其更节能且更快速。验证者是预先批准的，其权威来源于其身份和信誉。如果其行为恶意，将失去验证权和声誉。PoA确保只有合法且已验证的交易(如来自工业物联网传感器的数据条目)才会添加到区块链中，从而增加其安全度和可信度。 与使用PoW或PoS的公共区块链相比，使用PoA的私有区块链在工业物联网应用中具有多个优势。首先，其显著提高了能源效率，因为不需要与PoW相关的密集计算挖矿过程。在交易速度方面，由于共识过程中涉及的节点数量减少，使用PoA的私有区块链提供了更快的处理时间。区块链的私有性质确保了更高的安全性和对网络的控制，降低了外部攻击的风险，并允许更好地管理参与网络的传感器设备。虽然PoS也在能源效率方面有所改善，但选择结合PoA的私有区块链因为其更快的交易验证、更低的延迟和更高的安全控制，更符合工业物联网的特定需求。 3.3.4 创建区块 通过PoA机制达成共识后，下一步是形成新的区块。该区块封装了经过验证的数据或交易以及时间戳和对先前区块的引用等元数据。区块创建后，将进行加密哈希处理，生成唯一的块哈希值，此哈希与区块的内容一起确保数据的完整性和不可变性，将新形成的区块附加到区块链，建立按时间顺序排列且防篡改的数据记录。 3.4 工业物联网传感器设备访问 第4阶段重点关注工业物联网传感器设备与私有区块链之间的交互，此阶段从工业物联网传感器设备的数据请求到最终数据检索和传输的事件顺序，包括请求发起、网关处理、零知识证明挑战生成和响应以实现最终数据传输的步骤，确保数据完整性和可访问性。 3.4.1 请求发起 工业物联网传感器设备向私有区块链网关发起数据请求。当传感器需要数据时，向私有区块链网关发送结构化请求。此请求包含所需数据的类型、任何特定的时间范围或参数以及用于验证设备身份的认证凭证。网关在接收到该请求后，启动流程以验证设备的真实性并检索请求的数据。 3.4.2 网关处理 在接收到工业物联网传感器设备的数据请求后，私有区块链网关会启动一系列操作。首先，网关使用存储的凭证或加密方法验证请求设备的真实性。设备通过身份验证后，网关会解析请求所需的具体数据或信息。基于解析得到的信息，网关与底层区块链基础设施或其他集成系统交互，以检索相关数据。在整个过程中，网关确保遵循数据访问策略，确保只有授权设备才能接收相应的数据。 3.4.3 零知识证明挑战生成和响应 私有区块链网关采用零知识证明加密技术来加强安全措施，网关(作为验证者)确定请求的工业物联网传感器设备(作为证明者)是否拥有特定的凭证。通过向工业物联网传感器设备发送零知识证明挑战，网关确保只有具备正确知识的设备才能准确响应。挑战响应机制可有效阻止未授权的实体访问数据，且成功的零知识证明挑战和响应会被缓存以提高验证效率。 3.4.4 数据检索与传输 通过零知识证明响应成功验证工业物联网传感器设备的真实性后，私有区块链网关将启动数据检索过程。网关在区块链中搜索传感器请求的特定数据或交易记录，找到后，提取数据并准备传输。网关确保数据得到适当打包，保持其完整性和安全性。随后，将打包的数据传输到发出请求的物联网设备，使其能够访问其所需的信息。在整个过程中，网关确保数据传输高效、安全，优先考虑传输数据的机密性和准确性。 4 结语

This briefing will be used for the quarterly business analysis meeting with corporate executives and should adopt a professional and rigorous business language style. The data is as follows: Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on the 9th shows that in 2024, China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.2% year-on-year, while the Producer Price Index (PPI) fell by 2.2% year-on-year, with the decline narrowing by 0.8 percentage points compared to the previous year.\n\n\"The consumer market operated steadily in 2024, with overall price levels remaining stable. Notably, in recent times, core CPI has continued to rise, and the year-on-year decline in PPI has narrowed, sending positive signals,\" said Liu Fang, a researcher at the Market and Price Research Institute of the National Development and Reform Commission.\n\nLooking at the latest monthly data, in December 2024, CPI rose by 0.1% year-on-year, while core CPI (excluding food and energy prices) increased by 0.4% year-on-year, with the increase expanding by 0.1 percentage points compared to the previous month, maintaining an upward trend.\n\nLiu Fang pointed out that as a package of incremental policies and previously introduced stock policies continue to take effect, demand-side recovery is pushing price improvements. Core CPI rose from 0.1% in September 2024 to 0.4% in December, showing clear signs of economic recovery.\n\nIn China's CPI \"basket\" of goods, food accounts for a relatively high proportion. Throughout 2024, food prices fell by 0.6% year-on-year. In December, food prices turned from a 1.0% year-on-year increase in the previous month to a 0.5% decrease, with a month-on-month decline of 0.6%.\n\n\"The above-seasonal decline in food prices in December was mainly due to favorable warm winter weather conditions, which benefited agricultural production, storage, and transportation, leading to price drops in fresh vegetables, fruits, and other fresh food items. Pork prices decreased due to sufficient supply affected by previous holding back of stock and secondary fattening,\" said Wen Bin, Chief Economist at China Minsheng Bank.\n\nRegarding non-food prices, throughout 2024, they rose by 0.4% year-on-year. In December, non-food prices turned from flat in the previous month to a 0.2% year-on-year increase, and from a 0.1% month-on-month decrease to a 0.1% increase.", "checklist": [{"name": "Economic Data Analysis Depth", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how thoroughly the response analyzes and interprets the CPI and PPI data, including historical context, trends, causal factors, and economic implications for businesses.", "1-2": "Superficial mention of data points without meaningful analysis.

The increase in vehicle sales\nover the fourth quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the increase in delivery volume, partially offset by the lower average\nselling price as a result of changes in product mix.

{"index": 109, "domain1": "Finance & Business", "domain2": "Human Resource Management", "query": "作为一名中小企业的人力资源经理，需要基于2023年最新的《劳动法》及相关司法解释，详细梳理企业在劳动合同管理过程中的法律风险点和防范建议。具体要求：\n1. 全文不少于5000字\n2. 需分为三大模块：签订环节、续签环节、解除环节，每个模块需包含：\n   - 关键法律条款解读\n   - 常见争议案例分析（至少3个典型案例）\n   - 实操风险点清单\n   - 合规管理建议\n3. 结合自身企业经历，说明曾经遇到的实际问题及解决方案\n\n可参考以下内容：\n三大模块关键法律条款解读：\n①签订环节：\n我国《劳动法》规定订立劳动合同时应遵循多项重要法律条款。要明确用人单位信息、劳动者个人信息，确定劳动合同有效期、劳动者工作职责与工作场所、工作和休息休假安排，还要详尽约定薪资待遇、社保福利、劳动安全保护等方面，这些规定旨在确保劳动关系稳定和维护劳动者权益。\n②续签环节：\n    （一）用人单位应在劳动合同期满前与劳动者协商续签事宜。若用人单位维持或者提高劳动合同约定条件续订劳动合同，劳动者不同意续订的，劳动合同终止，用人单位无需支付经济补偿。\n    （二）若用人单位降低劳动合同约定条件续订劳动合同，劳动者不同意续订的，劳动合同终止，用人单位应当向劳动者支付经济补偿。\n    （三）劳动合同期满，劳动者仍在用人单位继续工作，用人单位超过一个月不满一年未与劳动者订立书面劳动合同的，应当向劳动者每月支付二倍的工资。\n    （四）连续订立二次固定期限劳动合同，且劳动者没有法定解除情形，续订劳动合同的，除劳动者提出订立固定期限劳动合同外，应当订立无固定期限劳动合同。用人单位违反规定不与劳动者订立无固定期限劳动合同的，自应当订立无固定期限劳动合同之日起向劳动者每月支付二倍的工资。\n③解除环节：\n    《劳动合同法》解除劳动合同相关规定\n    一、劳动者有下列情形之一的，用人单位可以解除劳动合同，并不用提前一个月通知和支付经济补偿金。\n    （一）在试用期间被证明不符合录用条件的\n    （二）严重违反用人单位的规章制度的；\n    （三）严重失职，营私舞，给用人单位造成重大损害的；\n    （四）劳动者同时与其他用人单位建立劳动关系，对完成本单位的工作任务造成严重影响，或者经用人单位提出，拒不改正的。\n    （五）因本法第二十六条第一款第一项（以欺诈、胁迫的手段或者乘人之危，使对方在违背真实意思的情况下订立或者变更劳动合同的）规定的情形致使劳动合同无效的\n    （六）被依法追究刑事责任的。\n    二、单位可以解除劳动合同，但是需要先通知工会，并提前一个月通知劳动者或是额外支付一个月的工资后，可以解除劳动合同：但需要按工龄支付经济补偿金。\n    （一）劳动者患病或者非因工负伤，在规定的.医疗期满后不能从事原工作，也不能从事由用人单位另行安排的工作的\n    （二）劳动者不能胜任工作，经过培训或者调整工作岗位，仍不能胜任工作的\n    （三）劳动合同订立时所依据的客观情况发生重大变化，致使劳动合同无法履行，经用人单位与劳动者协商，未能就变更劳动合同内容达成协议的。\n    （四）依照企业破产法规定进行重整的\n    （五）生产经营发生严重困难的\n    （六）企业转产、重大技术革新或者经营方式调整，经变更劳动合同后，仍需裁减人员的：七）其他因劳动合同订立时所依据的客观经济情况发生重大变化，致使劳动合同无法履\n行的。\n\n三大模块实操风险点清单：\n①签订环节：\n劳动合同签订过程中可能存在的主要风险在劳动合同订立过程中，潜在的法律风险主要包括以下几个方面：首先，如果用人单位未能在有效时间范围内向劳动者签署劳动合同，将会面临法律责任：自用工之日起超过一个月但未满一年仍未与劳动者签署书面劳动合同的情况下，用人单位需要每月支付给劳动者两倍的工资；若用工之日起满一年仍然没有与劳动者签署书面劳动合同，那么便等同于用人单位已经与该劳动者签定了无固定期限的劳动合同。\n②续签环节：\n    劳动合同续签时，需注意以下风险防范要点\n    （一）确认员工意愿。在合同到期前，提前与员工沟通，明确其是否有续签意向。若员工无意续签，应及时办理离职手续，避免劳动纠纷。\n    （二）审查合同条款。仔细检查原合同条款，根据实际情况和法律法规变化，对相关条款进行修订和完善。例如，薪酬、工作内容、工作地点等关键条款，应确保清晰明确目符合双方意愿。\n    （三）关注特殊情况。对于符合签订无固定期限劳动合同条件的员工，如连续工作满十年等，应依法签订无固定期限劳动合同，否则可能面临支付双倍工资等法律风险。\n    （四）遵循法定程序。续签合同需按照法定程序进行，包括通知员工、协商条款、签订合同等环节，确保程序合法合规。\n    （五）留存相关证据。在整个续签过程中，要注意留存相关的沟通记录、通知文件、合同文本等证据，以备后续可能发生的争议解决之需。通过上述措施，可有效防范劳动合同续签过程中的法律风险。\n③解除环节：\n1、未签订书面解除协议;\n双方协商解除劳动合同的，不论是用人单位还是劳动者都可以提出。但如果是用人单位提出的，用人单位应向劳动者支付相应的经济补偿金;如果是劳动者提出的，用人单位则不需支付经济补偿金。\n\n但无论是哪方提出解除，用人单位都应签订劳动合同解除协议，用书面的形式将协商内容确定下来。一则规范用人单位人事管理程序，二则防止个别劳动者恶意仲裁(诉讼)。当然如果用人单位能够做到在与劳动者协商解除合同的过程中让劳动者主动申请辞职，确认解除劳动合同是由劳动者本人率先提出的，这样用人单位就会节省相应的经济补偿金。当然，这样对劳动者来说是不公平的。\n2、解除协议内容违法;\n\n在劳动合同解除协议中，其内容条款不得违法法律强制性规定。比如约定劳动者在用人单位不支付相关费用的情况下的竞业禁止，这样的规定由于违反了法律强制性规定而归于无效，如果给劳动者造成损失，用人单位还要赔偿劳动者的全部损失。\n\n三大模块合规管理建议：\n①签订环节：\n1、进一步完善劳动合同内容。\n2、强化劳动合同制度运行的日常管理工作。\n3、建立和运用实用有效的管理手段，促进劳动合同的履行。\n4、落实劳动合同管理工作的责任制。\n5、加快建立和完善与劳动合同制度相配套的规章制度。\n6、加强劳动合同管理的监督工作。\n②续签环节：\n    1、建立合同到期提醒机制 利用电子表格或专门的合同管理软件，记录合同的起始日期、结束日期和续签提醒时间。提前设定合理的提醒时间，例如在合同到期前3个月、2个月、1个月分别发送提醒邮件或通知相关责任人。\n    2、评估合同履行情况回顾合同执行过程中的各项条款，包括服务提供、付款情况、质量标准等。收集双方在合作中的反馈和意见，了解是否存在未解决的问题或争议。\n    3、分析合作效益评估合作对本公司带来的经济收益、市场影响、战略价值等。考虑合作伙伴的表现和贡献，是否符合预期目标。\n③解除环节：\n1、完善规章制度并严格执行：规章制度的合法性与完善性是解除劳动合同的基石，企业必须确保制度在制定和执行过程中符合《劳动合同法》第4条的要求，并能有效公示到每位员工。规章制度的合规性是企业行使解除权力的前提保障。\n2、证据的妥善保存：解除劳动合同的每一步都需有充分的证据支持，尤其是涉及员工违纪或旷工时，证据的合法性和有效性至关重要。企业应建立完整的证据保存机制，如考勤记录、违纪行为的调查报告、沟通邮件等，确保在劳动争议中有理有据。《劳动合同法》第50条规定，企业应妥善保管相关材料，防止在争议中处于不利地位。\n3、人性化管理与合规并重：尽管解除劳动合同是企业管理的必要手段，但人性化管理也能有效降低法律风险和员工的不满。在解除前，通过沟通、辅导、警告等手段解决问题，既能体现企业的人性化管理理念，也能减少潜在的劳动争议风险。律师建议企业在合规的前提下，通过多种方式与员工建立良好的沟通渠道，减少因误解而产生的纠纷。\n4、法律顾问的参与：企业在解除劳动合同时，尤其是面对复杂的违纪或旷工情境，建议事先咨询专业律师或法律顾问，确保所有程序符合法律规定。这样不仅可以有效降低法律风险，也能在劳动争议发生时为企业提供有力的法律支持。《劳动合同法》第88条明确指出，违反解除程序的行为将导致严重的法律后果，因此法律顾问的参与可以为企业提供重要的合规保障。\n\n试用期约定、竞业限制、违约金、经济补偿金等热点问题：\n①试用期约定：\n    劳动合同试用期约定根据《劳动合同法》规定，劳动合同期限三个月以上不满一年的，试用期不得超过一个月：劳动劳动合同期限一年以上三年以下的，试用期不得超过二个月：三年以上固定期限和无固定期限的劳动合同试用期不得超过六个月。\n    《劳动合同法》同时规定：同一用人单位与同一劳动者只能约定一次试用期：以完成一定任务为期限的劳动合同或者劳动合同期限不满三个月的，不得约定试用期：劳动合同仅约定试用期或者劳动合同期限与试用期相同的，试用期不成立，该期限为劳动合同期限。\n    劳动者在试用期的工资不得低于本单位同岗位最低档工资或者劳动合同约定工资的百分之八十，并不得低于用人单位所在地的最低工资标准；在试用期中，除有证据证明劳动者不符合录用条件外，用人单位不得解除劳动合同。用人单位在试用期解除劳动合同的，应当向劳动者说明理由。\n②竞业限制：\n  竞业限制是《中华人民共和国劳动合同法》的重要内容，根据本法第二十三条、二十四条的规定，它是用人单位对负有保守用人单位商业秘密的劳动者，在劳动合同、知识产权权利归属协议或技术保密协议中约定的竞业限制条款。\n  具体来说，竞业限制是指用人单位和知悉本单位商业秘密或者其他对本单位经营有重大影响的劳动者在终止或解除劳动合同后的，一定期限内不得在生产同类产品、经营同类业务或有其他竞争关系的用人单位任职，也不得自己生产与原单位有竞争关系的同类产品或经营同类业务。\n限制时间由当事人事先约定，但不得超过二年。竞业限制条款在劳动合同中为延迟生效条款，也就是劳动合同的其他条款法律约束力终结后，该条款开始生效。\n③违约金：\n    用人单位不能任意与劳动者约定违约金，根据规定，只有两种情况可以约定由劳动者支付违约金。\n    1、用人单位为劳动者提供专项培训费用，对其进行专业技术培训的，可以与该劳动者订立协议，约定服务期。劳动者违反服务期约定的，应当按照约定向用人单位支付违约金。违约金的数额不得超过用人单位提供的培训费用。用人单位要求劳动者支付的违约金不得超过服务期尚未履行部分所应分摊的培训费用。\n    2、用人单位与劳动者可以在劳动合同中约定保守用人单位的商业秘密和与知识产权相关的保密事项。对负有保密义务的劳动者，用人单位可以在劳动合同或者保密协议中与劳动者约定竞业限制条款，并约定在解除或者终止劳动合同后，在竞业限制期限内按月给予劳动者经济补偿。劳动者违反竞业限制约定的，应当按照约定向用人单位支付违约金。\n④经济补偿金：\n    根据劳动合同法第四十七条规定，解除或者终止劳动合同的经济补偿按劳动者在本单位工作的年限，每满1年支付1个月工资的标准向劳动者支付。6个月以上不满1年的，按1年计算；不满6个月的，向劳动者支付半个月工资的经济补偿。\n    月工资是指劳动者在劳动合同解除或者终止前十二个月的平均工资，劳动者工作不满十二个月的，按照实际工作的月数计算平均工资。月工资按照劳动者应得工资计算，包括计时工资或者计件工资以及奖金、津贴和补贴等货币性收入。\n    劳动者月工资高于用人单位所在直辖市、设区的市级人民政府公布的本地区上年度职工月平均工资3倍的，向其支付经济补偿的标准按职工月平均工资3倍的数额支付，向其支付经济补偿的年限最高不超过12年。这里的月工资是指劳动者在劳动合同解除或者终止前12个月的平均工资。\n\n结合自身企业经历，说明曾经遇到的实际问题及解决方案：\n实际问题：\n某家政公司是一家通过互联网平台提供月嫂、保姆服务的公司。2022年8月3日，该公司与张某签订《合作协议书》，其中约定：“即日起张某在某家政公司旗下平台进行接单，接单期间严格遵守公司的各项规章制度，对公司机密存在保密义务，服务过的客户如有二次以上的服务要求或服务过的客户介绍其他的客户等，全部要统一交给公司分配派单，不私自接单。”后某家政公司（甲方）又与张某（乙方）签订《家政服务用工协议》，其中约定，乙方于2022年8月19日至2022年8月28日参加甲方母婴护理师的课程培训，并完成上岗技能专项课程，经甲方考核合格后根据等级给予安排就业，就业期限为一年；乙方必须服从甲方在工作期间的规章制度和管理，遵守国家法律法规所规定的职业道德，执行劳动安全卫生操作规程，乙方在合同期内违规操作所有问题后果自负等。同时，该协议中明确了各等级家政人员的薪资标准。经过培训后，张某于2022年9月4日开始上岗工作，某家政公司为其记录考勤，工作期间某家政公司每周安排两次商务礼仪培训，要求无特殊情况不得请假，若不参加培训将被罚款。张某的工资实行按件计费，其获得订单的50%作为提成工资，由某家政公司按月进行支付。工作半年后，张某认为，其与某家政公司应为劳动关系，某家政公司应为其缴纳社会保险费。某家政公司则认为双方属于合作关系，张某可以自由选择是否接单，其不对张某进行管理，双方不构成劳动关系，故无须为张某缴纳社会保险费。因协商未果，张某遂向劳动人事争议仲裁委员会（以下简称仲裁委员会）提出仲裁申请。\n解决方案：\n实践中，传统意义上的家政公司通常仅仅起到中介作用，即家政公司为雇主介绍符合雇主要求的家政人员，从中收取介绍费，而家政人员的工作内容、薪酬标准、休假等则均由雇主与家政人员自行协商确定，并且由雇主直接向家政人员支付报酬，此种情况下家政公司并不对家政人员进行劳动管理，双方不构成劳动关系。近年来，随着家政行业的规范化发展及平台经济的兴起，家政行业的用工形式日渐多样化。2024年6月17日，人力资源社会保障部等7部门联合发布《关于加强家政服务职业化建设的意见》（人社部发〔2024〕49号），其中指出，鼓励家政企业引入现代企业经营模式，提升专业化、规范化管理水平，打造家政服务品牌；支持和引导有条件的家政企业，逐步向员工制家政企业转型发展。利用互联网平台提供家政服务的企业，对于符合确立劳动关系情形的劳动者，应当依法与其订立劳动合同并参加社会保险。仲裁委员会将根据用工事实认定企业和劳动者的关系，依法维护家政人员合法权益，服务保障家政服务业高质量发展。\n\n各地方政府对劳动合同管理的特殊规定：\n北京市劳动合同规定：\n第一条　为了规范劳动合同制度，保护劳动者及用人单位的合法权益，根据《中华人民共和国劳动法》及有关规定，结合本市实际，制定本规定。\n\n第二条　本市行政区域内的企业、个体工商户及民办非企业单位(以下统称为用人单位)与劳动者建立劳动关系，应当依据本规定订立劳动合同。国家机关、事业单位、社会团体与劳动者建立劳动合同关系，依照本规定执行。\n\n第三条　劳动合同是劳动者与用人单位确立劳动关系，明确双方权利和义务的协议。\n\n第四条　订立和变更劳动合同，应当遵循平等自愿、协商一致的原则；劳动合同的订立、变更、解除、终止和续订，不得违反法律、法规、规章的规定。劳动合同依法订立即具有法律约束力，当事人必须履行劳动合同规定的义务。\n\n第五条　市、区人力资源和社会保障部门负责劳动合同制度实施的监督管理。\n\n第六条　用人单位应当依法建立和完善有关工作时间、劳动报酬、休息休假、职业培训、安全卫生、保险和福利、劳动纪律等方面的劳动规章制度，保护劳动者的合法权益。\n\n第七条　工会依法帮助、指导劳动者订立和履行劳动合同，并对用人单位订立和履行劳动合同的情况进行监督。用人单位违反劳动法律、法规、规章和劳动合同的，工会有权提出意见或者要求重新处理；劳动者申请仲裁或者提起诉讼的，工会依法给予支持和帮助。",

{"index": 121, "domain1": "Finance & Business", "domain2": "Sales Report", "query": "1、任务量分析：\nA、按季度划分：\n针对2013年的任务量，两千台的销售额。如将两千台的销售额按季度进行划分，每季度的任务量应该在500台。按百分比进行统计，每季度的销售后应为25%。而截止到五月份，2013年销售额只有577台，第一季度为337台，第一季度销售额仅为全年的：20%，低于预期销售5%。按滚动方式，将5%滚动到第二季度，第二季销售额应为30%。但截止到五月份，第二季度的销售额为：240台，因此6月份我们的销售额应达到423台方可完成上半年的销售任务。\nB、按月份划分：\n  如按月份划分平均分配，2013年我们的销售额情况如下：\n   月份\n任务额\n1月\n2月\n3月\n4月\n5月\n6月\n7月\n8月\n9月\n10月\n11月\n12月\n2000\n（单位：台）\n150\n50\n180\n180\n180\n200\n210\n210\n200\n200\n190\n50\n其中2月放假时间长，因此销售额适当减少；12月份临近放假，因此销售量适当减少。\n根据以上数据结合我公司2013年实际销售情况，6-12月我们的销售任务非常艰巨。\n2、产品结构分析：\n  2013年我们对产品质量进行全面提升，血球产品在行业内来说，各方面反映均占优等的。质量稳定，性能可靠，如不出现批量性的质量问题，我们产品是非常稳定的。据目前销售出去的仪器整体情况来看，终端用户反映也很不错。有了不错的口碑、稳定的质量。因此我们下一步要进行全面销售。\n3、价格体质：\n  今年我们主要人用仪器主要投放型号为：PE-6100型号，动物使用型号主要投放型号为：PE-6800VET。相对于2011年和2012年在产品在性能上有了很大的提升，原来的单通道改成了目前的双通道产品，速度和性能各方面都有了提升。但是在价格上2013年的产品价格同比2011年、2012年略微下调了。且2013年我们也有很多优惠政策，因此价格上我们有了绝对的优势。\n4、市场分析：\n  2013年整体市场行情三分类血细胞分析还是占很大优势。目前市场上大家对五分类血细胞分析仪虽有了一定的概念，但是却不够成熟。目前市场上国产品牌的五分类产品并不成熟，只是噱头大。新旧产品交替时，新产品不够成熟时，往往用户依赖的还是成熟的旧产品。一来质量稳定，二则价格合适，三则技术力量完善。因此三分类血细胞分析仪的占有量还有很大上升空间。今明两年三分类血细胞分析仪需求量还会程上升趋势。\n  从以上数据来看，我们的产品在质量上有了提升，价格上有了更多空间，市场行情好。万事俱备只欠东风，因此我们今明两年应该放开收来做，努力拼搏。\n二、区域分析：\n  目前我公司在各个区域均有人员负责，但各区域人员数量不多，基本是一人负责多个省份。人员负责省份跨区幅度大，造成部分地区无法覆盖到位。近三年来各区域销售情况如下：\n人员\n区域\n2011年\n2012年\n2013年\n吴富军\n广东、江西、湖南、湖北\n104\n139\n68\n邓建勇\n四川、重庆\n15\n35\n19\n高付森\n河南\n51\n41\n37\n单亦正\n山东\n14\n34\n41\n胥兴旺\n四川、西藏、重庆\n66\n42\n84\n徐长水\n贵州、云南\n32\n27\n14\n沈伟\n安徽\n9\n15\n25\n何磊\n湖南\n0\n12\n7\n吴殿帅\n河北、天津、北京\n334\n240\n213\n于川越\n辽宁\n4\n19\n8\n阳龙武\n新疆、甘肃、青海、宁夏\n14\n29\n0\n王克忠\n东北三省\n58\n34\n34\n刘建庆\n山西\n30\n16\n22\n齐梦飞\n唐山\n0\n0\n1\n四、销售趋势分析\n  我公司的销售客户群体主要有两大部分：一为私人用户，即经销商、终端客户等；二为政府机构，即政府招标方式。但统计近三年的销售数据发现目前我公司销售主任主要针对群体为私人用户，即经销商销售。以下为近三年招标出货和零售出货数据：\n年份\n招标\n零售出货\n备注\n2011\n283\n571\n全年统计数量\n2012\n264\n502\n全年统计数量\n2013\n185\n171\n截止到五月份统计数量\n\n根据以上内容撰写公司三年国内血球销售数据统计分析报告，请从不同角度给出分析，并结合实际情况给出发展后续建议，2000字左右。", "checklist": [{"name": "Data Analysis Comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how thoroughly the response analyzes the sales data across different dimensions (quarterly, monthly, regional, product-based, and customer segments), and whether all provided statistics are accurately interpreted.", "1-2": "Analysis completely misinterprets the data or ignores major portions of the provided statistics.

The article should be professional yet easily understood by the general public, around 2000 words.\nLegal Responsibilities in the Sanlu Milk Powder Incident\n\nWhile the shadow of the \"big head babies\" incident in Fuyang has not yet fully dissipated, another large-scale infant illness caused by milk powder quality issues has caught public attention. To avoid a repeat of the 2006 \"Qi'er Medicine\" counterfeit drug incident where victims had no recourse for compensation, this analysis examines civil, criminal, and administrative aspects to provide legal assistance to victims.\n\nGenerally, consumers can protect their rights through the following methods after consumption disputes:\n1. Negotiating with operators - lowest cost, high efficiency, good social effect\n2. Requesting consumer association mediation - voluntary, requires agreement signing but lacks enforcement power\n3. Appealing to administrative departments\n4. Arbitration based on agreement\n5. Filing lawsuits in court - the final legal remedy for product quality disputes\n\nAccording to the Product Quality Law, consumers or other victims can seek compensation from either sellers or manufacturers for personal injury or property damage caused by product defects. The Sanlu company's melamine-contaminated infant formula has caused one infant death and kidney problems in nearly 100 infants, qualifying as personal injury from product defects. Compensation should cover medical expenses, care costs during treatment, lost income, and additional costs for disability or death cases.\n\nThe statute of limitations for filing such lawsuits is two years from when the party knew or should have known about the damage. Guardians of affected infants should file suits promptly after Sanlu's September 11th announcement.\n\nCourts with jurisdiction include those where: the product was manufactured, sold, the tort occurred, or where the defendant is located.\n\nCriminal liability may also apply under food safety laws. Intentionally adding melamine constitutes the crime of producing and selling toxic food products, carrying penalties up to life imprisonment or death depending on consequences.\n\nBackground:\nOn September 11th, Sanlu Group announced the recall of infant formula produced before August 6, 2008, due to melamine contamination. The Ministry of Health reported multiple cases of infant urinary system stones linked to Sanlu formula.\n\nApplicable Laws:\n1. Consumer Protection Law\n2. Product Quality Law\n3. Civil Law\n4.

欧键汶送了四支笔，樊利杰送了两支笔，张敏送了两支笔，朱长根寄来十九支笔，唐燕琳寄来八支笔……\n这是前些日子朋友与学生给我毛笔时，我做的一个记录。有的笔杆上还用娟秀的楷书刻了我的名字，是笔庄专门制作的。它们有的用来写榜书，有的只能写小楷。它们的装饰各有不同：有的笔躺在考究的锦盒里，显示出高贵的神情；有的连简装都没有，来人从提袋里取出两支，递给我，说“试试”。包装不包装，对我来说是没用的，能不能用，才是我所关心的。\n我说的是毛笔。\n每一管笔，在未启用时都是锋棱尖锐的，似乎可以把点画的细处毫厘不爽地勾勒出来。只有付之于水，让水把千百毫毛化开，试用，才可以断其优劣。\n有书写癖好的人，笔是越多越好。笔多了，就有一个广大的选择空间，用来写行草，或者写篆隶、落款。如果写小楷，更是讲究笔锋之美。每位书写者都会根据自己的书写习惯去选择，长锋或者短锋，软毫或者硬毫——毕竟，拥有一管称心的笔，那是很开怀的。\n在一个文学活动的入口处，有一本红色的洒金册页摊开着，旁边是一方厚实的砚台，搁着一支毛笔，还有一支硬笔，让与会者签名，使这本册页承担一些纪念的责任——如果没有这本册页，来的人直接就登堂入室了。而现在，略微停顿一下。有的人选择了毛笔，拈起来，濡墨，一气呵成。有人选择硬笔，也拈起来，不必濡墨，也一气呵成。很明显，执硬笔签名者居多—— 一个人从未有过对毛笔的亲近，小时以硬笔行，及长则以键盘行，指腕间总是迎接硬朗的回应，也就心中有数。如果选择毛笔，拈在指中，像拿筷子夹菜一样，真不知落下时是何种反应。好在时下的人不会有多少在意，彼此彼此。一个时代过去了，工具得到了转换，执笔的姿势也大有不同，反而是不多的执毛笔签名者，他们以一种差异的表现作为对比。\n我当然是执毛笔签名者的一员——再没有什么比毛笔更称手了。尽管不是自己用惯的那管笔，却也相差不远，柔中有韧，足以把自己的名字写好。在文房用具里，毛笔给人洁净曼妙的美感。未使用时，它如一枚未绽放的白玉兰花苞，紧抱收束。遇水之后，丝缕蓬松。物尽其用——再洁净的笔锋也要裹上墨香，然后在宣纸上驰骋，就如骏马不是养着欣赏，而是用来征逐，看它们毛鬣竖起，迎风翻飞，筋肉上热气腾腾。毛笔也一样，如果不与黑亮的墨汁浸润，那一管笔是没有什么实际作用的，再好的笔性也裹在里面不能出来。一束毛在笔匠手上历经多个工序，变成一支笔，此时不再是动物属性，而是具有了漫游意识的精神，等待与之相投合的那个人，纵横张放。时日久了，人性笔性浑然无痕，便写出不少锦绣文字，那真是一管笔的巅峰时刻。像虞世南的《孔子庙堂碑》、褚遂良的《雁塔圣教序》、欧阳询的《九成宫醴泉铭》，正是在笔性最佳的节点上。智永为用秃的笔置笔冢，是让人深信的，那么多笔的襄助，使他写下了“《千字文》八百本，散与人间”，其中深情，唯有自知。\n在书写史上，最有名的笔就是王羲之写下《兰亭序》的那管鼠须笔——它是怎么一种样子，谁也没见过，却被书法史记录下来，似乎《兰亭序》的成功与这管笔不可分离，是王羲之借助了这管笔的精良。个体的成功，使后人思考与之的种种关系，曲水风雅，诗酒流连，名士情怀，最终落实在一管笔上。人胜于动物最大的地方，就是人善于研制工具并利用它们。毛笔的出现，极大地丰富了书写的美感，而禽兽的价值，由此有了高下之别。卫夫人倚重笔的力量，她认为武士靠剑锋，辩士靠舌锋，而文士就只能靠笔锋了。她对笔的要求似乎也很谙熟，认为要“取崇山绝仞中兔毫，八九月收之，其笔头长一寸，管长五寸，锋齐腰强者”。后来就有了“笔锋杀尽中山兔”的说法，无数矫健奔跑于山野的兔子为了文士的书写奉献了自己。实际上，一只野兔，最多也只能制一管笔。所幸山野幽深广大，禽兽众多，为制笔提供了不尽的资源。岁深日久，制笔的行当也渐渐壮大，面对每一根细微飘忽的毛羽，按照工序一道道做去。他们都是一些举轻若重的人——把毛变成毛笔，这是多么了不起的事。\n在两位朋友家中见到了作为装饰的毛笔。高大的红木笔架上，悬挂着几管大笔。笔杆用动物的角，打磨细腻，闪动光泽。笔毛则取自某些大型动物，绵长垂下。主人说这是从哪个作坊定制的，它们专门做毛笔的装饰品，而对书写的笔则毫无兴趣。他说了一个价格——天啊，要远远高于我手头上的好笔。毛笔装饰使室内文雅柔和多了，让人想起王羲之、颜真卿、苏东坡这些人来。这和买很多书来放在家里有异曲同工之妙，从美好处想，主人还是要表达诗礼传家、彤管继世的愿望。譬如出一个文曲星，也是离不开毛笔的。那些喜好真实书写的人，一直运用最古老的工具、姿势在进行，希望书写可以改变命运。杜子美献赋给唐玄宗，希望自己的才华能得到赏识，就是用毛笔写成的。苏东坡认为一个人笔秃千管就可以成名成家。他自己就是这么过来的，写了那么多诗、词、文，好像一天不写都不行。赵孟頫说他一天可以写一万个字，康里子山又三倍于他。由此可以想见一个人热爱书写所达到的心手双畅的程度：笔与纸如此紧密地、迅疾地摩擦，是否有一些毛羽折损下来？一个文士的声名，就是靠勤快的书写来积累的——手不离笔，就是那些过往时代的一个特征，到处可见毛笔，可见毛笔字。\n许多年前我见到了敦煌残经，寻常人的力量在书写中显露出来。似乎日常生活就是写，写了那么多，心也写得静如古井、净同莲花。它们都堆在一起，黏在一起，需要专业的人将它们一片片剥离开来。不过，我们现在看到的就只有写经了，那些写的人、写的笔，都化为尘泥了。我是根据点画在心里还原一管笔的神采的，行于中锋，雍容轻逸。我临摹许多年了，总是觉得在简净上做得不好，我想不是笔的问题，而是我自身出了问题。\n一管轻柔，在颜真卿手上，居然写得出如此厚实，真是幽燕老将气韵沉雄；而让赵佶使用，只见瘦硬坚挺，见骨不见肉。至于张旭、怀素酒后纵横千万字，让人惊异一管笔禁得起如此狂野的横扫。蔡邕认为“惟笔软则奇怪生焉”，把笔对美的贡献提到一个绝高的层次。蔡邕本人就善用笔，他对笔的认知肯定是有根据的—— 一个人看重书写的美好，觉得笔就是他精神的延伸，可以倚仗它来打天下。王羲之认为纸是阵营，墨是铠甲，砚是城池，而笔是刀槊，随时快刀相向准备厮杀。这样的比喻虽不文雅，但一管笔随时都在破关蹈隘、攻城略地，使得废纸三千，又是书写的真实。现在我们说“颜体”“柳体”“欧体”“赵体”……都是用笔打出的声名，世代相传。如今书法同道于交流中，都会互询近来学了什么，这些以个人姓氏命名的书法特征，便会钩沉而起。至于那些被冠之以癫、狂、奇、怪的书法家，也是因为用笔迥异于常规而被史册记载，甚至成为后人茶余饭后的谈资，似乎大家对他们都熟悉，可以荤荤素素地说一通。我觉得俗说没什么意思，就像“扬州八怪”，岂可以一个“怪”字囊括之？郑燮的下笔与金农有那么多差异，黄慎与罗聘哪里是同一条路径，真是各怪其怪，无一同者。一管笔给每个人无限的想象空间，笔下的心事也截然相远，每个人与自己周旋久了，倚仗一管笔，做好自己。\n毛笔，算得上文房四宝中最与文士亲近者——砚台厚重，置于案台后，一般就不会去挪动它了，有谁会成天抱着砚台摩挲？而研墨通常由书童来承担。当年苏东坡和米南宫在章丘相遇，边喝酒边挥毫，所用墨汁就是两个书童奋力研磨出来的。至于纸，人与之接触也是通过笔，寄寓个人的小得意小欢愉。沈尹默认为：“龙蛇起伏笔端出，使笔如调生马驹。”他是把笔当作鲜活之物来看待的。起始人驹相远，你不知我，我不知你，端的难以顺手，只能每日周旋，渐悉笔性。人与笔周旋久了，也就渐入佳境。这些来自不同禽兽的毛羽都是有脾性的，这源于那些野性十足的身体，即便与之脱离，野性还是在纤细的毛羽里潜伏下来，伺机发作。一管笔是否适宜自己，只有泡开来写才能察知。也许起始是人笔分离的，经过磨洗，渐渐得之心应之手——这当然是最开心的事。有的过了一段时间仍然不称于心、手，也只能人笔作别。人与笔，是有机缘于其间的，有的只有很短暂的一点交集。\n朋友赠送的笔，羊毫为多，狼毫次之，其他禽兽毛羽较少。大抵山羊众多，黄鼠狼有限，且黄鼠狼再多，尾巴上也不会有多少适于制笔的毛。羊毫柔软，狼毫坚韧，我向来取前者，以为羊毫能驾驭，也就没有什么笔是驾驭不了的。这是我从很久以前读到的刘墉诗里明白的道理。他说：“笔软墨丰皆入妙，无穷机轴出清新。”软毫在手，落纸似有若无，如何能从指腕传递于心弦，知其轻重缓急？别无他法，只能每日执笔，在生宣上不辍写去。笔软则捉摸无定：墨汁太足，糊了一大片；墨汁太稠，行笔却艰涩了。速度太慢，点画臃肿全无神采；速度太快，又生出躁气火气。便觉得不是朝夕之事，应以长久计之。古人追求的笔下指标如此让人惊叹——驱心若游丝之缳飞英，含毫如郢斤之斫蝇翼，真是精微之至。回首古代那些善于用笔者，笔下是毫不苟且的，正是常年调节而成，说起来是太费时日与精力。世上的精神生活、物质生活似乎都应如此，才能过得好一点，像庖丁解牛、佝偻承蜩，既顾到了生活，又使精神快慰，也就开心透了。如此细细磨炼，恒久地周旋一管笔，指腕之力由弱而强，发觉笔锋传递过来的信息明显提升，便心中暗喜，不告知他人——书写，是全然私有之事，也就在一个很孤单的心境下独行。这也使一个喜好书写的人有一些偏执，或者有一些自恋，总是自行其道不管不顾。就像张瑞图，那么喜好露锋而作，一眼望去满纸锋芒，刺眼之至。尽管他也知道儒家的审美观倾向厚重、敛约、安和……但一下笔，还是以露锋出现，如行之于刀尖。说起来，一个人驾驭一管笔，就是以笔为马，纵横自任。\n一管笔使熟了，可以出道了，便四处写去，以此襄助功名。像沈度，被明成祖看上了，摆脱了籍籍无名的过去，开始了富贵荣华，他是“学成文武艺，货与帝王家”的典型。柳公权是从另一个角度来看待一管笔的，他对唐穆宗说：“心正则笔正”。显然已经超越了一般人的日常使用与理解。后人是用“笔谏”的含义来给这五个字定性的。而米南宫掷笔于地的动作，也被历史记录下来。笔何辜，如此待之。这样，和笔有关的传说就多了起来，有梦笔生花的，梦仙人授笔法、笔势的，虚幻的成分弥漫，一管笔就变得神秘起来。执笔人有时正经肃穆，庄重地写墓志铭、纪功碑，人也情深笔也规矩。有时则信马由缰，给朋友写写信，松懈一下。这些文人简札都是我最感兴趣的，不再是贯虱穿杨的精到，却都闲澹无饰。写信是人与笔最轻逸的时刻，不必才藻新奇灿若披锦，就是家常话语，说近来消息。信札，是说不上写得好写不好的，写得自然即可。这也使一管笔顺其性，疾徐交替，虚实互见，奇正相生，写到哪儿算哪儿，人与笔都如清风漫步。如果一个人连写信都刻意造作，完全可以联想他日常生活的方方面面也大抵如此。\n无数管笔在纵横开合中折损了——毛笔无疑是一种耗材，当笔锋销尽成为秃管，它就再难以重现铁画银钩的精美，只能告别。那么，一个喜好书写的人，从孩童时起就没断过，最终会有多少管笔在指腕间穿过？少年时的笔是用来打基础的，后来的笔就不断创造了美感，也为主人赢得了荣誉。再往后，它就是老者的慰藉了，开心时写写，不开心时也写写。\n秃笔多了起来。后来的人不再效仿智永设笔冢，又重新插回笔筒，不忍舍弃。\n又一管新笔，上场了。",

{"index": 227, "domain1": "Education", "domain2": "Admissions Promotion", "query": "Please help revise our tutoring center's parent meeting speech manuscript. The focus should be on explaining the advantages of one-on-one tutoring (including teaching staff arrangements, personalized teaching plans, learning progress tracking, etc.) in about 2000 words. Here is the original speech manuscript Dear Parents and Colleagues,\n\nThank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedules to attend today's parents' meeting. Today, we gather here to discuss our children's education and growth, and we hope that through this exchange, we can further enhance the understanding and cooperation between parents and the tutoring center, working together to pave the way for our children's future.\n\nAs an educator, I deeply understand that every parent carries beautiful expectations for their children. Your expectations and trust are the driving force behind our continuous progress. Our initial intention in establishing this tutoring center is to help children improve their academic performance through professional guidance, stimulate their interest in learning, cultivate independent thinking and problem-solving abilities, and help them become more confident and composed on their life journey.\n\nI. Teaching Philosophy\n\nOur teaching philosophy is \"teaching according to students' aptitude with personalized guidance.\" We understand that each child has their own strengths and potential, as well as their own weak areas. Therefore, through comprehensive analysis of each student's situation, we customize teaching plans for each child to ensure that every student can improve effectively at their own pace.\n\nWe don't simply pursue improvement in test scores but focus more on developing children's comprehensive abilities. Our goal is to help children learn how to learn and how to think, ultimately unleashing their potential and enabling them to have stronger competitiveness in their future lives.\n\nII. Curriculum Design and Teaching Arrangements\n\nIn curriculum design, we follow a scientific teaching system, combining school curriculum standards and exam requirements for targeted tutoring. Our tutoring courses are mainly divided into the following aspects:\n\n    Basic Foundation Courses: Help children master basic subject content through systematic knowledge explanation, building a solid academic foundation.\n    Specialized Enhancement Courses: Provide targeted intensive training for children's weak areas in specific subjects or knowledge points.\n    Thinking Development and Practical Courses: Besides traditional classroom teaching, we also cultivate children's innovative thinking and problem-solving abilities through extended learning and practical activities.\n\nTo ensure teaching effectiveness, we combine small-class teaching with one-on-one tutoring, striving to achieve efficient interaction and personalized guidance in every class.\n\nIII. School-Parent Cooperation\n\nEducation is an endeavor that requires joint efforts from both school and family. We believe that children's growth depends not only on classroom tutoring but also on family support and cooperation. Therefore, we hope to establish closer cooperative relationships with parents to jointly focus on children's learning and psychological development.\n\nParents' participation is crucial. We encourage parents to actively communicate with us and provide timely feedback on children's performance and difficulties in learning. Only when parents, teachers, and children form a three-way force can we better promote children's overall development.\n\nFor this purpose, we have established regular parent meetings and individual communication mechanisms. We will regularly report children's learning progress to parents, discuss learning issues, and provide improvement suggestions based on specific situations. Meanwhile, we also hope parents can actively participate in their children's learning process, understand their interests and needs, and help them establish correct learning attitudes and living habits.\n\nIV. Expectations and Suggestions for Children\n\nDear parents, your children's choice to study with us means they have taken their first step toward self-improvement. We will do our best to provide professional guidance, but ultimate success requires both children's efforts and parental support.\n\nHere are some suggestions for parents:\n\n    Pay attention to children's psychological development: While grades are important, children's mental health and emotional needs are equally important. As parents, you should give children sufficient love and encouragement to help them build a positive mindset.\n    Set learning goals together with children: Discuss learning plans with children and encourage them to work toward their goals. Help children understand that learning is not just about passing exams but about achieving self-improvement.\n    Maintain good communication with the tutoring center: We welcome parents to provide feedback on any issues their children encounter during the learning process. Your suggestions and opinions are crucial for improving our teaching.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nFinally, thank you again for your trust and support. We know that education is a long-term process requiring patience, attention to detail, and perseverance. In the days ahead, we will continue to uphold our rigorous teaching attitude and responsibility to care for children, working hand in hand with parents to witness our children's growth and progress.\n\nThank you all!", "checklist": [{"name": "One-on-One Tutoring Focus", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how thoroughly the response emphasizes and elaborates on the advantages of one-on-one tutoring, including detailed explanations of teaching staff arrangements, personalized teaching plans, and learning progress tracking as specified in the query.", "1-2": "Completely fails to address one-on-one tutoring advantages;

NBSI3.0 等。 (二)数据库人侵攻击 数据库人侵包括默认数据库下载、 暴库下载以及数据库弱口令连接等攻击 方式。默认数据库漏洞，是指部分网站在使用开源代码程序时，未对数据库 路径以及文件名进行修改， 导致攻击者可以直接下载到数据库文件进行攻击。 暴库下载攻击是指利用 IIS 的％5C 编码转换漏洞， 造成攻击者在提交特殊构 造的地址时，网站将数据库真实物理路径作为错误信息返回到浏览器中。攻\n\n_x000C_击者即可以此下载到关键数据库。数据库弱口令连接人侵，攻击者通过扫推 得到的弱口令，利用数据库连接 工具直接连接到目标主机的数据库上，并依 靠数据库的存储过程扩展等方式，添加后门账号、执行特殊命令。 (三)文件上传漏洞人侵 网站的上传漏洞是由于网页代码中文件上传路径变量以及文件名变量过 滤不严造成的，利用这个漏洞可以将如.ASP 等格式的网页木马上传到网站服 务器，继而获得网站的服务器权限。很多网站都提供文件上传功能，以方便 用户发图、资源共享等。但由于上传功能限制不严，导致了漏洞的出现。上 传漏洞的成因如下：首先，对文件的扩展名或文件头验证不严密，导致上传 任意或特殊文件；其次，对上传文件的文件头标识验证不严，也会导致文件 上传漏洞。如攻击者可以修改文件头伪装图片，或对图片和木马进行合并， 写入数据库中，然后通过数据库备份将文件保存为指定格式的木马文件。 (四)跨站脚本攻击 跨站攻击，即 ecosssitescriptexecution(通常简写为 xss， 因为 CSS 与层叠 样式表同名，故改为 XSS)是指攻击者利用网站程序对用户输入过滤不足，输 入可以显不在页面上对其他用户造成影响的 HTML 代码， 从而盗取用户资料、 利用用户身份进行某种动作或者对访问者进行病毒侵害的一种攻击方式。 使用最多的跨站攻击方法莫过于 cookie 窃取，即获 cookie 后直接借助工具或 其他可修改 cookie 的浏览器， 被攻击者在访问网页时， 其 cookies 将被盗取。 跨站攻力还有一种用法是读取本地文件。\n\n_x000C_跨站脚本攻击的方式主要还是依靠利用者的 javascript 编程水平，攻击者 编程水平够高，就能达到更为复杂的攻击效果。诸如 Attack API, XSS shell、 XSS 蠕虫、读取浏览器密码、攻击 Firefox 插件等等。 (五)webshell 权限提升 一般而言，webshell 所获取的权限为 IIS_USER 权限，有些组件或应用程 序是不能直接运行的。为了提升 webshell 权限，攻击者往往会利用服务器上 的安全缺陷,或通过各种具有高权限的系统以及应用软件漏洞，来提高自己程 序的执行权限。 四、 缓沖区滋出攻击\n\n缓冲区溢出(buffer overflow)是一种系统攻击手段， 通过在程序缓冲区写超 出其长度的内容，造成缓冲区溢出，从而破坏程序堆找，使程序转而执行其 他指令达到攻击目的。 利用缓冲区溢出进行系统攻击必须满足的两个基本条件： 第一步， 将攻志 代码植入被攻击程序；第二步，使被攻击程序跳转到植入的攻击代码处执行， 通过精心设计的溢出字符串同时实现这两个步骤。将溢出字符串作为用户数 据提供给被攻击程序，用来溢出被攻击程序的缓冲区，实现溢出攻击，例如， 针对网络服务程序，构造特殊格式的交互数据包;针对浏览器或第三方插件程 序，构造特殊格式的网页；针对办公程序，构造特殊格式的文档，等等。通 过缓冲区溢出进行系统攻击的难点在于溢出字符串的设计，其中包括设计良 好的返回地址和攻击代码 shellcode。 返回地址的设计影响着溢出字符串格 式的设计，而 sheucode 的存放位置需要根据返回地址的设计来决定。 溢出 字符串存放在被攻击程序的堆找缓冲区内。为了执行溢出字符串中的\n\n_x000C_shellcode, 返回地址可以设计为直接指向 shellcode 的开始地址；或者可以在 shellcode 前加上一段 Nop 指令，返回地址设计为指向这段 NOP 指令中的某 个地址。 为了提高对返回地址猜测的命中率， 溢出字符串中可以存放多份返回地址 来提高覆盖函数原返回地址的成功率。 成功触发缓冲区溢出后，进程的控制权转交给 shellcode, shellcode 是溢出 字符串的有效负载，用来实现不同的攻击功能。shellcode 的手工生成十分繁 琐，为加快开发速度，可以通过自动化 shellcode 生成平台 Metasploit 来产生 所需的 shellcode,功能包括：本地提取、远程提权、下载执行、开放端口、反 弹连接、增添管理用户等。 在网络渗透攻击中， 攻击者可以利用缓冲区溢出直接控制多台主机， 特别 是在内网渗透当中，由于内网主机一般处于防火墙里面，缓冲区溢出攻击所 针对的端口不会被防火墙所屏蔽，因此缓冲区溢出成为内网横向权限提升最 有效的手段之一。 缓冲区溢出有两种方式，一种是远程溢出，另外一种是本地溢出。远程溢 出攻击是网络攻击中一种威力巨大的手段。攻击者可以通过远程溢出，直接 控制目标主机，获取最高权限：如针对 windows 的 MS08-067 漏洞，造成了 无数主机被溢出攻击。本地滋出的危害更多在于 webshell 提权上面。 缓冲区溢出攻击根据攻击目杨又可分为针对操作系统服务、 针对 WEB 平台服 务，以及针对第三方软件的滋出攻击。针对操作系统服务漏洞的主要有 RFC 服务远程溢出(包含多个，如冲击波，震荡波、扫荡波等)、W1NS 服务名称验 证漏洞、即插即用服务溢出漏洞等针对 WEB 平台服务的漏洞有 IIS 平台的\n\n_x000C_IDA、IDQ 漏洞， Apache 滋出漏洞，WEBDAV 溢出漏洞、邮件服务器的溢 出漏洞、对 FTP 服务器的溢出漏洞等。针对第三方应用软件的溢出漏洞有 ccproxy 代理溢出漏洞、Serv-U 眼务器漠出漏洞、ISS RealSecure/BlackICE 防 火墙溢出等。 五、 木马后门攻击\n\n木马后门攻击是攻击者延续其攻击效果的重要手段， 包括特洛伊木马、 网 页木马、隐秘后门、RootKit 等方式。攻击者通过木巧攻击，最终达到获取下 一时刻服务器控制权限的目的。攻击的主要手段:文件描绑攻击、文件自动感 染攻击、网页挂马攻击、账号密码破解攻击，预留后门攻法、RootKit 后门攻 击等。 (一)Rootkir 技术 Rootkit 与普通木马后门以及病毒的区别在于其更为强大的隐秘性，如通 信隐蔽、自启动项隐藏、文件隐藏、进程通信隐蔽、进程/模块隐藏、注册表 隐藏、服务隐藏、端口隐藏。Rootkit 本身并没有害处，但它可以作为其他恶 意代码的载体。其极强的隐蔽性给其他恶意代码的生存及传播提供了良好的 温床。Rootkit 大多数是深入操作系统内核的.通过进行代码的注人，以及一些 针对操作系统的漏洞的溢出攻击.或通过驱动程序加载的方式进人系统内核。 由于在绝大多数现代操作系统中都采用了整体单内核的设计；内核的各个模 块之间是互相透明的，只要 Rootkit 侵人了内核的任何一个部分，那么它就拥 有了整个系统的全部控制权。之后 Rootkit 可以进行很多操作，例如，隐藏文 件、进程，制造隐蔽的网络通信信道等等。 (二)网页挂马攻击\n\n_x000C_网页木马通常是指利用 IE 浏览器的一些漏洞，通过构造出特殊代码，在 网页中夹带木马程序，或一段使得客户端下载并执行指向木马程序连接地址 的攻击代码。使得其他上网者在浏览该网页时，会在后台悄悄执行网页中的 攻击代码，达到控制用户主机的目的。 常见网页木马主要有操作系统自带 lE 组件或其他软件漏洞网页木马和应 用软件漏洞网页木马。 对于第一类， 最典型的有 MIME 漏洞网页木马、 Active X 漏洞木马、OBJECT 对象漏洞木马。事实上，被曙光的 IE 浏览器漏洞一直 源源不绝，由于网页木马是由服务器攻击客户端，用户往往又是信任服务器 的，这类攻击产生的后果和危害往往是非常严重的。 六、 网络设备攻击\n\n路由器和交换机是最常见的网络设备，决定着内网与互联网之间的连接。 在攻击者入侵目标中，路由器和交换机是重要的攻击对象。在常用网络设备 中，Cisco 路由器占据主导地位。下面以 cisco 为例，介绍攻击者人侵路由器 的方法。 路由器远程控制方法一般有两种，一种是 telnet 或 HTTP 管理，一种是 SNMP 代理。前一种方式只适合管理小型局域网路由器，而后一种是更为常 用的管理方案。1. SNMP 社区字串弱口令每个 SNMP 启用的路由设备都包含 一个管理信息模块(MIB)，这是一种包含简单等级的数据目录结构,在这种树 结构中包含设备各种信息。通过 SNMP 命令 GET ，可以检索 MIB 的信息， 而 SET 命令则可设置 MIB 变量。 SNMP 协议通过社区(community)字串的概 念实现对设备 MIB 对象访问的权限。如： (conf)#snmp-server community read_only RO (conf)#snmp-server community read_write RW\n\n_x000C_上例中设置了只读访问的社区字串 read_only 和可进行读写操作的 read_write 社区字串。而大部分管理员喜欢使用 public 和 private 设置只读字串和读写字 串， 这种配置结果将给网络带来巨大的安全风险。 攻击者可以通过 SolarWinds 等路由器管理工具扫描到这些弱口令字串，并利用 TFTP 下载或上传配置文 件，破解其特权密码 或直接上传本地修改后的配置文件，达到完全控制路由 器的目的。 Cisco 配置文件中，意外创建和暴露 SNMP 共享字符串，可以允许未授权 地査阅或者修改感染的设备。这种漏洞是调用 SNMP 函数中的缺陷引起的。 SNMP 利用 community 的标记来划分 object 组，可以在设备上查看或者修改 它们。在组中的数据组织 MIB，单个设备可以有几个 MIBs，连接在一起形成 一个大的结构，不同的社团字符串可以提供只读或者读写访问不同的、可能 重叠的大型数掘结构的一部分。 启用 SNMP, 键入 snmp-server 时，如果社区在设备上不是以有效的社区 字串存在，就会不可预料地添加一个只读社区字率。如果删除它，这个社区 字串中将会在重载设备时重新出现。 缺陷源于 SNMPv2 的通知(informs)功能的实现， 这个功能包括交换只读社 区字符串来共享状态信息。当一个有漏洞设各处理一条定义接收 SNMP \"traps\"(陷阱消息)主机的命令时(常规 snmp-server 配置)， 在 trap 消息中指定的 社团也还是配置成通用，如果它在保存配置中没有定义。即使社区在前面被 删除并统配置在系统重载前保存到存储器，也会发生这种情况。 当通过\"snmpwalk\"(—种检测 SNMP 配置正确性的工具)， 或者使用设备的 只读社团字符串遍历基于社团的访问控制 MIB 来检查设备时，就会泄漏读写\n\n_x000C_社团字符串。这意味着知道只读社区字串允许读访问存储在设备中的 MIB, 导致信息泄露。而更为严重的是，如果知道读写社区字符串就可以允许远程 配置的路由，可以绕开授权认证机制，从而完全控制路由器的整体功能。 七、 内网渗透攻击\n\n(一)windows 系统密码破解 在内网渗透中，如果能得到域管理员的密码 Hash, 并破解之，将使攻击 者很可能通过此密码控制到整个网络。 在 windows 系统中，某个用户登陆系统后，其用户名和密码都是以明文 的方式保存在内存中的。控制用户登陆的系统进程是 winlogon.exe， 当有多 个用户同时登陆系统时，系统在每个用户登陆时都会产生一个 winlogon.exe 进程。当 AWGINA 模式被设置时，可以用 aio 等工具直接读取到当前用户的 密码。 攻击者在获取目标主机 emd shell 后，可以采用 LC5、 SAMInside 等工具 进行暴力或字典破解。然而，由于 windows 密码采用的是 NTLMHash 加密的 方式，对于一个位数不太长密码，完全可以采用查表法进行破解，opcrack 加 彩虹表进行查表搜索破解就是一个很好的选择。其在破解 14 位任意字符时， 一般都在几分钟之内。 (二)ARP 欺骗攻击 ARP 协议即地址解析协议 address resolution protocol, ARP 协议是将 Ip 地 址与网络物理地址一一对应的协议。负责 IP 地址和网+实体地址(MAC)之间 的转换。也就是将网络层(IP 层’也就是相当于 ISO OSI 的第三层)地址解析为\n\n_x000C_数据连接层(MAC 层，也就是相当于 ISOOSI 的第二层)的 MAC 地址。ARP 表支持在 MAC 地址和 IP 地址之间的一一对应关系， 并提供两者的相互转换。 由于 ARP 协议无法识别 ARP 谓求 kg 响应报文的衣实性，使得攻击者可以通 过抢先构造出 ARP 报文，对内网所主机以及交换设备进行欺编，从而达到流 量重定向的攻击的目的。 常见内网 ARP 欺骗攻击的主要手段有 ARP 内网挂马攻击，ARP 内网嗅 探攻击，ARP 挂马攻击主要使得内网主机在访问外部网页时，被强行插入一 个恶意网页木马链接，达到种植木巧的攻击效果。ARP 内网嗅探攻击主要是 攻击机在被攻击机与访问站点之间做一个中间人攻击，使得所有通信数据先 流向攻击机，再转发出去。常用内网鸣探攻击工具有 cain 、 cttcrcap。 八、 拒绝服务攻击\n\n在网络攻击中， 恶意攻击者为了破坏目标服务的可用性， 或者让目标服务 器进行重启来执行某些功能，通常会采用拒绝服务攻击的方式。拒绝服务攻 击的分类方法有很多种，从不同的角度可以进行不同的分类，而不同的应用 场合需要采用不同的分类。常用的柜绝服务工具有：SYN Flood, UDP Flood、 傀儡僵尸等分布式拒绝服务工具。 拒绝服务攻击可以是物理的(硬件的)，也可以是逻辑的(logic attack), 也称 为软件的(sofwareattack)。物理形式的攻击，如偷窃、破坏物理设备，破坏电 源等。 按攻击的目标又可分为节点型和网络连接型，前者旨在消耗节点(主机 host)资源，后者旨在消耗网络连接和带宽。而节点型又可以进一步细分为主 机型和应用型， 主机型攻击的目标主要是主机中的公共资源如 CPU、 磁盘等，\n\n_x000C_使得主机对所有的服务都不能响应；而应用型则是攻击特定的应用，如邮件 服务、DNS 服务、Web 服务等。受攻击时，受害者上的其他服务可能不受影 响或者受影响的程度较小(与受攻击的服务相比而言)。 按照攻击方式来分可以分为： 资源消耗和服务中止。 资源消耗指攻击者试 图消耗目标的合法资源，例如，网络带宽、内存和磁盘空间、CPU 使用率等。 服务中 止则是指攻击者利用服务中的某些缺陷导致服务崩淸或中止。 按受害者类型可以分为服务器端拒绝服务攻击和客户端拒绝服务攻击。 前 者是指攻击的目标是特定的服务器，使之不能提供服务(或者不能向某些客户 端提供某种服务)，例如，攻击一个 web 服务器使之不能访问；后者是针对特 定的客户端，即用户，使之不能使用某种服务，例如，游戏、聊天室中的\"踢 人\"，即不让某个特定的用户登录游戏系统或聊天室中，使之不能使用系统的 服务。 大多数的拒绝服务攻击(无论从种类还是发生的频率角度)是针对服务器 的，针对客户端的攻击一般发生得少些，同时因为涉及面小，其危害也会小 很多。 按攻击是否直接针对受害者， 可以分为直接拒绝服务攻击和间接拒绝服务 攻击，如要对某个 E-mail 账号实施拒绝服务攻击，直接对该账号用邮件炸弹 攻击就属于直接攻击为了使某个邮件账号不可用，攻击邮件服务器而使整个 邮件服务器不可用就是间接攻击。 按攻击地点可以分为本地攻击和远程(网络)攻击，本地攻击是指不通过网 络，直接对本地主机的攻击，远程攻击则必须通过网络连接。由于本地攻击 要求攻击者与受害者处于同一地，这对攻击者的要求太高，通常只有内部人 员能够做到。\n\n_x000C_九、\n\n网电空间对抗\n\n随着军用信息网络的发展，网电空间(cyberspace)成为继陆、海、天之后 的又一重要战场，网电空间对抗技术也逐渐成为各同军队争相发展的热点。 美军于 2009 年 6 月正式成立网电司令部，全面规划和管理各军种网电对抗 的指挥控制、信息共享、装备论证和作战训练。 网电空间是通过网络化系统相关物理基础设施，利用电子信号和电磁频 谱，存储、修改和交换数据的域，涵盖了信息的产生、处理、传输、使用、 存储的全过程，包括信息通过电磁信号在电磁频谱空间中传输的过程，是一 个全新的作战域。 网电空间中包含多种异构网络。 异构网络的连接方式包括物理连接和虚拟 连接。物理连接指异构网络之间通过网络设备互联，如计算机网络和移动通 信网络之间通过网关互联。虚拟连接指异构网络之间没有通过网络设备进行 直接连接，但可 以利用移动介质、终端等实现连接，如外部网络和隔离网络 之间没有直接连接但是可以通过移动介质、终端等实现两个网络间的信息传 输。 网电空间对抗的范围包括网电态势感知、 网电攻击和网电防御等三大领域 其基本模式是结合传统网络战和电子对抗的特色和优势，实现自上而下、自 下而上的信息干预，从而影响认知域。具体的技术发展思路内容包括两个层 面，即实现网络化的电子对抗和实现电磁化的网路攻击。 美军在网电对抗方面已经形成了一系列具有实战能力的技本和装备体系， 其中比较有代表性的包括：舒特系统、震网攻击技术、数字大炮、网电飞行\n\n_x000C_器等。其中震网攻击技术在针对伊朗核设施的作战应用中一举成名，成力目 前网电攻击的典型范例。 十、 攻击案例——震网攻击技术\n\n2009 年，伊朗核设施中大量浓缩袖离心机报废，核项目进展严重停滞。 2011 年 2 月，为防止核泄漏，伊朗宣布暂时卸载其布什尔梭电站的核燃料。 据权威反病毒机构分析显示，造成该事件的罪魁祸首为\"超级工厂\"（震网)病 毒。 经分析发现，超级工厂病毒攻击核电站的方法是:摧毁核电站的浓缩轴离 心机。为了摧毁离心机，病毒使用了三种方法： (1)在控制浓缩袖离心机的可编程逻辑控制器(PLC)上植人恶意代码，使离 心机和汽轮机超速运行，直至高温烧毁； (2)屏蔽监控系统的报警信号，使操作人员不能发现上述异常； (3)平时处于潜伏状态， 只有当离心机变频器频率在 600-1200HZ 间时才激 洁， 以增加隐蔽性。 而伊朗核电站保护重重，物理隔离，为了能成功接触控制离心机，病毒采 用了 三个步骤： (1)进人核电站：感染核电站工作人员的移动介质和西门子 step 7 工程文 件，在这些介质和工程文件被使用时，感染相应的主机； (2)网络渗透：通过移动介质、step 7 工程文件和局域网对核电站内部网络 进行不断的渗透； (3)定位并攻击：在渗透过程中，寻找控制可编程逻辑控制器(PLC)的计算 机, 并发起攻击。\n\n_x000C_核电站的控制网络结构一共分为四个部分，企业按制网、边缘网络、生产 操作网络和过程控制网。 企业校制网，用干对核电站信息的管理。生产操作网，主要用于在控制系 统、 ERP 系统和企业控制网之间交互信息。边缘网络，主要用于对控制系统 中的设备进行管理，为终端用户提供信息、对网络中软件提供补丁， 如更新 病毒库等。控制网包含了 PLC 编程的计算机，离心机电机以及控制这些电机 的可变频驱动器 VFD。 为了保证安全，网络中还有三层防火墙，每层防火墙过滤规则极为严格， 除了 工控系统的文件传输服务、 RFC 服务和数据库服务外， 其他全部不允许。 处于互联网的攻击者，为了能成功攻击浓缩袖离心机，必须穿透或绕过这几 层网络和三层防火墙。 震网病毒的渗透攻击过程如下所述。 (1)攻击开始时，攻击人员攻陷某工作人员家中的上网电脑，并通过该电 脑感染了他的 U 盘。 该工作人员工作时将被感染的 U 盘接人企业控制网的客 户端计算机，当用户打开该磁盘时，触发一个操作系统漏洞，病毒隐蔽植入 该计算机。接着病毒利用网络漏洞迅速感染企业网内部的其他计算机。 (2)由于核电站网络中，工作人员常需要通过 VPN 登录 CAS 服务器(中心 存档服务器)，中心服务器上部署了西门子的 wincc 数据库。病毒向该数据库 提交一个恶意的 SQL 请求，就可以攻陷 CAS 服务器，并在边缘网络内部传 播。 (3)存档服务器相当于一个数据中心，上面的数据来自于控制系统网络中 的 os 服务器。使用类似的方法，病毒可穿透后端防火墙，感染 0S 服务器，\n\n_x000C_并通过 网络在其内部感染控制 PLC 的工作站，对其修改，破坏与之相连的 离心机。 以上只是震网病毒其中一种传播方式， 此外还有很多种传播方式。 例如由 于病毒能感染西门子工程文件，工作人员可能直接将被感染的文件拷贝到企 业网中的客户端打开，导致病毒进人核电站内部网。\n\n12 个需要了解的黑客常用工具\n\n根据行业评论、反馈和经验，整理了 2018

\n摘要\n\n工程上的实测实量，是指利用测量工具，在工程现场对测量物体进行测量，根据相关质\n\n量验收标准与规范，与测量数据进行对比分析，最终能够得到真实反映物体质量数据的一种\n\n方法。但传统的实测实量需要人工记录测量数据并处理数据，工作量庞大且容易因为人为原\n\n因出现差错。随着网络化和数字化的发展，很多领域都实行了数字化和信息化管理，使得数\n\n据的存储和后期的处理都更加方便，因此在实测实量领域进行数字化信息化的相关研究具有\n\n很重要的实践意义。\n\n针对上述问题，本文以传统的实测实量工具为基础，设计和实现了基于物联网技术和语\n\n音识别技术的实测实量系统。本文的主要内容如下：\n\n首先，本文根据系统需求提出了系统整体设计方案，该系统由数据采集终端设备、无线\n\n通信模块和云平台组成。终端设备采集语音信息和传感器数据，通过无线通信模块将数据上\n\n传到云平台并进行存储，用户可以通过手机或者电脑在云平台上进行设备管理、数据查看功\n\n能。根据语音识别的要求，本文设计了三种识别方式的语音识别系统：基于离线语音识别模\n\n块的语音识别系统、基于 Kaldi 语音工具包训练的语音识别系统和基于语音云服务的在线语\n\n音识别系统，并对比分析了各自的特点。根据无线通信的要求，本文介绍了基于 NB-IoT 的\n\n物联网通信设计。通信系统以 BC26 模组为核心设计了硬件电路和软件程序，并通过 MQTT\n\n协议与云平台进行通信，可以将终端设备的数据上传至云平台进行存储和查看。\n\n最后，本文结合语音识别技术和物联网通信技术，设计了基于语音识别和物联网的实测\n\n实量工具系统。设备终端采用了 STM32F103C8T6 作为微控制器，负责控制各个模块的运行，\n\n接收和处理传感器数据。选用离线语音识别模块实现语音识别功能，可以方便收集和存储位\n\n置等信息，并通过显示屏模块进行显示。选用物联网模块用于实现微控制器与云平台进行通\n\n信，将采集数据上传至云平台进行存储。最后对系统进行了相关测试，包括系统硬件调试和\n\n数据通信功能测试和语音识别功能测试，测试结果表示系统能够稳定运行并能实现相关功能。\n\n关键词:

Please extract key information from the material, combine it with my college life, and add my personal reflections, using sincere and earnest wording.\nDeng Xiaoping was born on August 22, 1904, in Paifang Village, Xiexing Township (now Xiexing Town, Guang'an City), Guang'an County, Sichuan Province. His original name was Deng Xiangsheng. At age 5, he began his education in a private school, with the scholarly name Deng Xixian, and later transferred to a modern primary school. In September 1920, at age 16, Deng Xiaoping traveled to France on the steamship \"Anteliepon\" for work-study. In the summer of 1929, Deng Xiaoping went to Guangxi as a representative of the Communist Party of China to lead an uprising. Let's look at his story.\n\nDeng Xiaoping's Stories\n\n\"I am a pragmatist,\" was Deng Xiaoping's self-assessment. Upholding truth, maintaining integrity, and daring to speak up were not only Deng Xiaoping's distinct political character but also his unique leadership style.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Deng Xiaoping frequently expressed his opinions on problems emerging in national economic construction. In spring 1961, following central directives to promote investigation and research, Deng inspected rural areas in Beijing's Shunyi district. Addressing the chaos caused by \"arbitrary transfer of resources\" and \"communist wind\" in rural economies, and the numerous problems with public dining halls, he decisively pointed out: eating in dining halls is socialism, not eating in dining halls is also socialism - the decision should be based on the masses' opinions.\n\nIn 1962, in response to severe natural disasters, various production forms emerged spontaneously in rural areas: some places used production teams as accounting units, while others implemented household responsibility systems. There were different opinions within the Party on how to view these issues, and the masses awaited clear answers from the central leadership. In this context, Deng Xiaoping conducted extensive research to quickly restore and develop agricultural production. In July 1962, at two different meetings addressing agricultural production relations, Deng stated: The purpose of adjusting agricultural production relations is to develop rural productive forces; we shouldn't be rigid about production forms. Whatever form the masses prefer should be adopted... To illustrate this point, Deng used the Sichuan saying \"It doesn't matter if a cat is black or yellow, as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat\" to express his approval of the household responsibility system. Due to Deng's clear stance and the vivid \"cat theory,\" these speeches spread widely. Although the \"cat theory\" was later criticized, historical practice has proved that this pragmatic theory showed tremendous vitality.\n\nDeng Xiaoping said: \"I haven't read many books, but I believe in Chairman Mao's principle of seeking truth from facts.\" It was this belief and adherence to seeking truth from facts that made him practical in work, honest in character, focused on real results rather than empty talk. He also strongly advocated emancipating minds, organically combining it with seeking truth from facts, and restored and established our Party's correct ideological line.\n\nWhen Deng Xiaoping returned to power for the third time, he was 73 years old, but his mental agility and liberated thinking surpassed many young people. Deng humorously said: \"Some foreigners used to see me as a reformist and others as conservatives.\" \"I am a reformist, true; if upholding the Four Cardinal Principles makes one conservative, then I am also conservative. So more accurately, I am a pragmatist.\" By seeking truth from facts, proceeding from basic national conditions and the reality of the primary stage of socialism, while maintaining both the path to a strong nation and its founding principles, China's socialist cause with Chinese characteristics continues to achieve new accomplishments that draw worldwide attention.", "checklist": [{"name": "Adherence to Content Integration", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how effectively the response integrates the provided material about Deng Xiaoping with college life experiences and personal reflections, as required by the query.", "1-2": "Completely fails to integrate the provided material with college life;

"蛮子大妈\n\n描写了法国农民抗击侵略者的实例。\n\n一\n\n我有十五年不到韦尔洛臬去了。今年秋末，为了到我的老友塞华\n\n尔的围场里打猎，我才重新去了一遭。那时候，他已经派人在韦尔洛\n\n臬重新盖好了他那座被普鲁士人破坏的古堡。\n\n我非常心爱那个地方，世上真有许多美妙的角落，教人看见就得\n\n到一种悦目的快感，使我们不由得想亲身领略一下它的美。我们这些\n\n被大地诱惑了的人，对于某些泉水，某些树林子，某些湖沼，某些丘\n\n陵，都保存着种种多情的回忆，那固然是时常都看得见的，然而却都\n\n象许多有趣味的意外变故一样教我们动心。有时候，我们的思虑竟可\n\n以回到一座树林子里的角落上，或者一段河岸上，或者一所正在开花\n\n的果园里，虽然从前不过是在某一个高兴的日子里仅仅望见过一回。\n\n然而它们却像一个在春晴早起走到街上撞见的衣饰鲜明的女人影子一\n\n般留在我们心里，并且还在精神上和肉体上种下了一种无从消磨和不\n\n会遗忘的欲望，由于失之交臂而引起的幸福感。\n\n在韦尔洛臬，我爱的是整个乡村：小的树林子撒在四处，小的溪\n\n河像人身的脉络一样四处奔流，给大地循环血液，在那里面捕得着虾\n\n子，白鲈鱼和鳗鱼！天堂般的乐趣！随处可以游泳，并且在小溪边的\n\n深草里面时常找得着鹧鸪。\n\n当日，我轻快得像山羊似地向前跑，瞧着我两条猎狗在前面的草\n\n里搜索。塞华尔在我右手边的一百公尺光景，正穿过一片苜蓿田。我\n\n绕过了那一带给索德尔森林做界线的灌木丛，于是就望见了一座已成\n\n废墟的茅顶房子。\n\n突然，我记起在一八六九年最后那次见过的情形了，那时候这茅\n\n顶房子是干干净净的，包在许多葡萄棚当中，门前有许多鸡。世上的\n\n东西，哪儿还有比一座只剩下断壁残垣的废墟，更令人伤心的？\n\n我也记起了某一天我在很乏的时候，曾经有一位老妇人请我到那\n\n里面喝过一杯葡萄酒，并且塞华尔当时也对我谈过那些住在里面的人\n\n的经历。老妇人的丈夫是个以私自打猎为生的，早被保安警察打死。\n\n她的儿子，我从前也看见过，一个瘦高个子，也像是一个打猎的健\n\n将，这一家子，大家都叫他们做\"蛮子\"。\n\n这究竟是一个姓，或者还是一个诨名？\n\n想起这些事，我就远远地叫了塞华尔一声。他用白鹭般长步儿走\n\n过来了。\n\n我问他：\"那所房子里的人现在都怎么样了？\"\n\n于是他就向我说了这件故事。\n\n二\n\n普法之间已经正式宣战的时候，小蛮子的年纪正是三十三岁。他\n\n从军去了，留下他母亲单独住在家里。他们并不很替她担忧，因为她\n\n有钱，大家都晓得。\n\n她单独一人留在这所房子里了，那是座落在树林子边上并且和村\n\n子相隔很远的一所房子。她并不害怕，此外，她的气性和那父子两个\n\n是一般无二的，一个严气正性的老太太，又长又瘦，不常露笑容，人\n\n们也绝不敢和她闹着耍。并且农家妇人们素来是不大笑的。在乡下，\n\n笑是男人们的事情！因为生活是晦暗没有光彩的，所以她们的心境都\n\n窄，都打不开。男人们在小酒店里，学得了一点儿热闹的快活劲儿，\n\n他们家里的伙伴却始终板起一副严肃的面孔。她们脸上的筋肉还没有\n\n学惯那种笑的动作。\n\n这位蛮子大妈在她的茅顶房子里继续过着通常生活。不久，茅顶\n\n上已经盖上雪了。每周，她到村子里走一次，买点面包和牛肉以后就\n\n仍旧回家。当时大家说是外面有狼，她出来的时候总背着枪，她儿子\n\n的枪，锈了的，并且枪托也是被手磨坏了的。这个高个儿的蛮子大妈\n\n看起来是古怪的，她微微地偻着背，在雪里慢慢地跨着大步走，头上\n\n戴着一顶黑帽子，紧紧包住一头从未被人见过的白头发，枪杆子却伸\n\n得比帽子高。\n\n某一天，普鲁士的队伍到了。有人把他们分派给居民去供养，人\n\n数的多寡是根据各家的贫富做标准的。大家都晓得这个老太婆有钱，\n\n她家里派了四个。\n\n那是四个胖胖的少年人，毛发是金黄的，胡子是金黄的，眼珠是\n\n蓝的，尽管他们已经熬受了许多辛苦，却依旧长得胖胖的，并且虽然\n\n他们到了这个被征服的国里，脾气却也都不刁。这样没人统率地住在\n\n老太太家里，他们都充分地表示对她关心，极力设法替她省钱，教她\n\n省力。早上，有人看见他们四个人穿着衬衣绕着那口井梳洗，那就是\n\n说，在冰雪未消的日子里用井水来洗他们那种北欧汉子的白里透红的\n\n肌肉，而蛮子大妈这时候却往来不息，预备去煮菜羹。后来，有人看\n\n见他们替她打扫厨房，揩玻璃，劈木柴，削马铃薯，洗衣裳，料理家\n\n务的日常工作，俨然是四个好儿子守着他们的妈。但是她却不住地记\n\n挂她自己的那一个，这个老太太，记挂她自己的那一个瘦而且长的、\n\n弯钩鼻子的，棕色眼睛，嘴上盖着黑黑地两撇浓厚髭须的儿子。每\n\n天，她必定向每个住在她家里的兵问：\n\n\"你们可晓得法国第二十三边防镇守团开到哪儿去了？我的儿子在\n\n那一团里。\"\n\n他们用德国口音说着不规则的法国话回答：\"不晓得，一点不晓\n\n得。\"后来，明白她的忧愁和牵挂了，他们也有妈在家里，他们就对她\n\n报答了许多小的照顾。她也很疼爱她这四个敌人；因为农人们都不大\n\n有什么仇恨，这种仇恨仅仅是属于高等人士的。至于微末的人们，因\n\n为本来贫穷而又被新的负担压得透不过气来，所以他们付出的代价最\n\n高；因为素来人数最多，所以他们成群地被人屠杀而且真地做了炮\n\n灰；因为都是最弱小和最没有抵抗力的，所以他们终于最为悲惨地受\n\n到战争的残酷祸殃；有了这类情形，他们所以都不大了解种种好战的\n\n狂热，不大了解那种激动人心的光荣以及那些号称具有政治性的策\n\n略；这些策略在半年之间，每每使得交战国的双方无论谁胜谁败，都\n\n同样变得精疲力竭。\n\n当日地方上的人谈到蛮子大妈家里那四个德国兵，总说道：\n\n\"那是四个找着了安身之所的。\"\n\n谁知有一天早上，那老太太恰巧独自一个人待在家里的时候，远\n\n远地望见了平原里，有一个人正向着她家里走过来。不久，她认出那\n\n个人了，那就是担任分送信件的乡村邮差。他拿出一张折好了的纸头\n\n交给她，于是她从自己的眼镜盒子里，取出了那副为了缝纫而用的老\n\n光眼睛；随后她就读下去：\n\n蛮子太太，这件信是带一个坏的消息给您的。您的儿子威克多，\n\n昨天被一颗炮弹打死了。差不多是分成了两段。我那时候正在跟前，\n\n因为我们在连队里是紧挨在一起的，他从前对我谈到您，意思就是他\n\n倘若遇了什么不幸，我就好当天告诉您。\n\n我从他衣袋里头取出了他那只表，预备将来打完了仗的时候带给\n\n您。\n\n现在我亲切地向您致敬。\n\n第二十三边防镇守团二等兵黎伏启\n\n这封信是三星期以前写的。\n\n她看了并没有哭。她呆呆地待着没有动弹，很受了打击，连感觉\n\n力都弄迟钝了，以至于并不伤心。她暗自想道：\"威克多现在被人打死\n\n了。\"随后她的眼泪渐渐涌到眼眶里了，悲伤侵入她的心里了。各种心\n\n事，难堪的，使人痛苦的，一件一件回到她的头脑里了。她以后抱不\n\n着他了，她的孩子，她那长个儿孩子，是永远抱不着的了！保安警察\n\n打死了老子，普鲁士人又打死了儿子……他被炮弹打成了两段，现在\n\n她仿佛看见那一情景，教人战栗的情景：脑袋是垂下的，眼睛是张开\n\n的，咬着自己两大撇髭须的尖子，像他从前生气的时候一样。\n\n他的尸首是怎样被人拾掇的，在出了事以后？从前，她丈夫的尸\n\n首连着额头当中那粒枪子被人送回来，那末她儿子的，会不会也有人\n\n这样办？\n\n但是这时候，她听见一阵嘈杂的说话声音了。正是那几个普鲁士\n\n人从村子里走回来，她很快地把信藏在衣袋里，并且趁时间还来得及\n\n又仔仔细细擦干了眼睛，用平日一般的神气安安稳稳接待了他们。\n\n他们四个人全是笑呵呵的，高兴的，因为他们带了一只肥的兔子\n\n回来，这无疑是偷来的，后来他们对着这个老太太做了个手势，表示\n\n大家就可以吃点儿好东西。\n\n她立刻动手预备午饭了；但是到了要宰兔子的时候，她却失掉了\n\n勇气。然而宰兔子在她生平这并不是第一次！那四个兵的中间，有一\n\n个在兔子耳朵后头一拳打死了它。\n\n那东西一死，她从它的皮里面剥出了鲜红的肉体；但是她望见了\n\n糊在自己手上的血，那种渐渐冷却又渐渐凝住的温暖的血，自己竟从\n\n头到脚都发抖了；后来她始终看见她那个打成两段的长个儿孩子，他\n\n也是浑身鲜红的，正同那个依然微微抽搐的兔子一样。\n\n她和那四个兵同桌吃饭了，但是她却吃不下，甚至于一口也吃不\n\n下，他们狼吞虎咽般吃着兔子并没有注意她。她一声不响地从旁边瞧\n\n着他们，一面打好了一个主意，然而她满脸那样的稳定神情，教他们\n\n什么也察觉不到。\n\n忽然，她问：\"我连你们的姓名都不晓得，然而我们在一块儿又已\n\n经一个月了。\"他们费了好大事才懂得她的意思，于是各人说了各人的\n\n姓名。这办法是不能教她满足的；她叫他们在一张纸上写出来，还添\n\n上他们家庭的通信处，末了，她在自己的大鼻梁上面架起了眼镜，仔\n\n细瞧着那篇不认得的字儿，然后把纸折好搁在自己的衣袋里，盖着那\n\n封给她儿子报丧的信。\n\n饭吃完了，她向那些兵说：\n\n\"我来给你们做事。\"\n\n于是她搬了许多干草搁在他们睡的那层阁楼上。\n\n他们望见这种工作不免诧异起来，她对他们说明这样可以不会那\n\n么冷；于是他们就帮着她搬了。他们把那些成束的干草堆到房子的茅\n\n顶那样高，结果他们做成了一间四面都围着草墙的寝室，又暖又香，\n\n他们可以很舒服地在那里睡。吃夜饭的时候，他们中间的一个瞧见蛮\n\n子大妈还是一点东西也不吃，因此竟担忧了。她托词说自己的胃里有\n\n些痛。随后她燃起一炉好火给自己烘着，那四个德国人都踏上那条每\n\n晚给他们使用的梯子，爬到他们的寝室里了。\n\n那块做楼门用的四方木板一下盖好了以后，她就抽去了上楼的梯\n\n子，随后她悄悄地打开了那张通到外面的房门，接着又搬进了好些束\n\n麦秸塞在厨房里，她赤着脚在雪里一往一来地走，从容得教旁人什么\n\n也听不见，她不时细听着那四个睡熟了的士兵的鼾声，响亮而长短不\n\n齐。\n\n等到她判断自己的种种准备已经充分以后，就取了一束麦秸扔在\n\n壁炉里。它燃了以后，她再把它分开放在另外无数束的麦秸上边，随\n\n后她重新走到门外向门里瞧着。\n\n不过几秒钟，一阵强烈的火光照明了那所茅顶房子的内部，随后\n\n那简直是一大堆骇人的炭火，一座烧得绯红的巨大焖炉，焖炉里的光\n\n从那个窄小的窗口里窜出来，对着地上的积雪投出了一阵耀眼的光\n\n亮。\n\n随后，一阵狂叫的声音从屋顶上传出来，简直是一阵由杂乱的人\n\n声集成的喧嚷，一阵由于告急发狂令人伤心刺耳的呼号构成的喧嚷。\n\n随后，那块做楼门的四方木板往下面一坍，一阵旋风样的火焰冲上了\n\n阁楼，烧穿了茅顶，如同一个巨大火把的火焰一般升到了天空；最\n\n后，那所茅顶房子整个儿着了火。\n\n房子里面，除了火力的爆炸，墙壁的崩裂和栋梁的坠落以外，什\n\n么声音也没有了。屋顶陡然下陷了，于是这所房子烧得通红的空架\n\n子，就在一阵黑烟里面向空中射出一大簇火星。\n\n雪白的原野被火光照得像是一幅染上了红色的银布似地闪闪发\n\n光。\n\n一阵钟声在远处开始响着。\n\n蛮子大妈在她那所毁了的房子跟前站着不动，手里握着她的枪，\n\n她儿子的那一杆，用意就是害怕那四个兵中间有人逃出来。\n\n等到她看见了事情已经结束，她就向火里扔了她的枪。枪声响了\n\n一下。\n\n许多人都到了，有些是农人，有些是德国军人。\n\n他们看见了这个妇人坐在一段锯平了的树桩儿上，安静的，并且\n\n是满意的。\n\n一个德国军官，满口法国话说得像法国人一样好，他问她：\n\n\"您家里那些兵到哪儿去了？\"\n\n她伸起那条瘦的胳膊向着那堆正在熄灭的红灰，末了用一种洪亮\n\n的声音回答：\n\n\"在那里面！\"\n\n大家团团地围住了她。那个普鲁士人问：\n\n\"这场火是怎样燃起来的？\"\n\n她回答：\n\n\"是我放的。\"\n\n大家都不相信她，以为这场大祸陡然教她变成了痴子。后来，大\n\n家正都围住了她并且听她说话，她就把这件事情从头说到尾，从收到\n\n那封信一直到听见那些同着茅顶房子一齐被烧的人的最后叫唤。凡是\n\n她料到的以及她做过的事，她简直没有漏掉一点。\n\n等到说完，她就从衣袋里面取了两张纸，并且为了要对着那点儿\n\n余火的微光来分辨这两张纸，她又戴起了她的眼镜，随后她拿起一\n\n张，口里说道：\"这张是给威克多报丧的。\"又拿起另外一张，偏着脑\n\n袋向那堆残火一指：\"这一张，是他们的姓名，可以照着去写信通知他\n\n们家里。\"她从从容容把这张白纸交给那军官，他这时候正抓住她的双\n\n肩，而她却接着说：\"您将来要写起这件事的来由，要告诉他们的父母\n\n说这是我干的。我在娘家的名姓是威克多娃·西蒙，到了夫家旁人叫\n\n我做蛮子大妈。请您不要忘了。\"\n\n这军官用德国话发了口令。有人抓住了她，把她推到了那堵还是\n\n火热的墙边。随后，十二个兵迅速地在她对面排好了队，相距约莫二\n\n十米。她绝不移动。她早已明白；她专心等候。\n\n一道口令喊过了，立刻一长串枪声跟着响了。响完之后，又来了\n\n一声迟放的单响。\n\n这个老婆子并没有倒在地下。她是弯着身躯的，如同有人斩了她\n\n的双腿。\n\n那德国军官走到她的跟前了。她几乎被人斩成了两段，并且在她\n\n那只拘挛不住的手里，依然握着那一页满是血迹的报丧的信。\n\n我们的朋友塞华尔接着又说：\n\n\"德国人为了报复就毁了本地方的古堡，那就是属于我的。\"\n\n我呢，我想着那四个烧在火里的和气孩子的母亲们；后来又想着\n\n这另一个靠着墙被人枪毙的母亲的残忍的壮烈行动。\n\n末了，我拾着了一片小石头，从前那场大火在它上面留下来的烟\n\n煤痕迹依然没有褪。\n剧本\n介绍人物（所有）\n比如：\n周朴园——某煤矿公司董事长，五十五岁。(《雷雨》)\n人物介绍要有名字，身份，有时还要年龄，生平简介（如《茶馆》），性格特点等，有利于演员进一步把握角\n色的特征。\n介绍“景”：\n景是指具体故事发生的时代背景，主要的地点等，在《雷雨》中就将四幕的布景都做了介绍。\n2.正文：\n第N幕\n人物（本幕出现的）：……\n时间（具体）：……\n地点：……\n[幕启：介绍故事发生的背景，开幕的布景，人物的动作\nXXX：（XXX的动作）……对白\n[可以是不同人物的动作\n——幕落\n有时会有旁白或独白，以（）的形式写在相应位置\n\n我是一名大学戏剧社团的导演，希望将这部短篇小说改编成适合大学生演出的舞台剧剧本，剧本篇幅控制在90分钟内

{"index": 377, "domain1": "Literature & Arts", "domain2": "Screenplay", "query": "The Battle of Red Cliffs refers to the battle where the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei decisively defeated Cao Cao's large army in the area of Red Cliffs (now northwest of Chibi City, Hubei Province) along the Yangtze River in 208 CE (the 13th year of Jian'an). This is one of China's most famous battles where the few defeated the many and the weak overcame the strong. It is the most renowned of the \"Three Major Battles\" of the Three Kingdoms period and was the largest river battle in the Yangtze River region since He Lü's defeat of Chu.\n\nCao Cao led an army of 200,000 troops downstream along the Yangtze River. Sun Quan appointed Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu as left and right commanders, with Lu Su as military advisor. Zhou Yu led an elite force of 30,000 troops upstream to Xiakou, joining with Liu Bei's forces stationed at Fankou to advance westward along the Yangtze River, meeting Cao's army at Red Cliffs. By this time, many of Cao's soldiers had fallen ill. In the initial engagement, Cao's forces were defeated and temporarily retreated to the Wulin area, while Zhou Yu and his forces remained on the southern bank, with both sides facing each other across the river. Zhou Yu exploited Cao Cao's arrogance and underestimation, adopting his subordinate Huang Gai's suggestion to use fire attacks. They devised a plan of false surrender, sending Huang Gai with ten small warships loaded with straw and oil under the pretense of surrender. When the ships were about two li from Cao's camp, they were set ablaze and, aided by the wind, charged toward Cao's forces. Cao's army suffered a major defeat, with ships burned and heavy casualties extending to their camps on shore. Cao Cao ordered the burning of his remaining ships and retreated, with about half of his remaining troops dying from hunger and disease.\n\nThe Battle of Red Cliffs, where Sun Quan and Liu Bei allied against a powerful enemy, demonstrated the effectiveness of naval warfare and clever use of fire attacks, creating a famous example in Chinese military history of the weak defeating the strong. This battle laid the foundation for the tripartite division of the Three Kingdoms.Please adapt the [Battle of Red Cliffs] into a 2-hour Peking Opera script for use as educational material to promote traditional culture among young people.

Please help me create a video narration script about Ukiyo-e art for art museum guides. The content should focus on Katsushika Hokusai's representative works, using professional yet accessible language suitable for visitors with basic art knowledge. Specifically, it should include: 1) A relaxed and elegant introduction to the basic concepts of Ukiyo-e art; 2) Detailed analysis of Hokusai's \"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji\" series, especially the composition, color, and symbolic meaning of \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\"; 3) Analysis of Ukiyo-e art development in relation to the social and cultural background of the Edo period; 4) Interactive segments that encourage audiences to reflect on Ukiyo-e's influence on later art. The language style should be formal yet friendly, incorporating interesting details, with a duration of approximately 15 minutes.\n\nReference materials: Historical Social Life in the Edo Period: Ukiyo-e art reached its peak during the Edo period, which was inseparable from the social and cultural background of the time. The Edo period was a relatively stable and peaceful time in Japanese history. The shogunate implemented a strict social class system, creating a stable environment for artists to create. Meanwhile, urban development, especially centered around Edo, promoted the prosperity of commerce, handicrafts, and artistic culture.\n\nDuring this period, the rise of the urban class showed a strong interest in arts and culture. Ukiyo-e, with its vivid depiction style, colorful presentation, and popular content themes, attracted many viewers and became one of the mainstream art forms of the time. Ukiyo-e works covered various subjects, including actors, beautiful women, natural landscapes, historical events, and daily life scenes, attracting audiences from different social classes and making ukiyo-e art part of popular culture.\n\nThe production process of ukiyo-e was complex and precise. An artist would first create an original painting, usually a watercolor or ink painting, as a template for the final ukiyo-e. Then, woodblock carvers would copy it onto wooden blocks and precisely carve the lines and details. Ukiyo-e was typically a multicolor woodblock print, requiring a separate block for each color, completing the final work through overlapping prints of different colors. This multicolor woodblock printing technique was a complex and delicate craft at the time.\n\nThe Edo period had a strict social structure divided into four classes: samurai, farmers, artisans, and merchants. The samurai class was at the top of society and enjoyed privileges, but with the arrival of peacetime, their military role gradually weakened, shifting towards administrative and cultural fields. Farmers were the main productive force in society, while artisans and merchants, though at the bottom of the social hierarchy, gradually gained wealth and influence as the economy prospered.\n\nDevelopment of Ukiyo-e Art:\nUkiyo-e (浮世絵) was a popular form of woodblock printing in Japan's Edo period, depicting daily life, folk customs, landscapes, and popular figures like kabuki actors and courtesans with fluid lines and vibrant colors. It vividly represented the lives and fashion trends of various social classes, serving as an encyclopedia of Japanese folk culture.\n\nThe development of ukiyo-e can be divided into four stages: early emergence in the 17th century, maturation in the 18th century, peak in the 19th century, and gradual decline in the 20th century. Its artistic characteristics are mainly reflected in:\n\nRich Themes: Ukiyo-e works covered scenes of daily life, historical stories, legends and myths, portraits of famous people, and beautiful women.\n\nVivid Colors: Ukiyo-e works used woodblock color printing techniques with bright colors, making the works particularly colorful and rich.\n\nStrong Decorative Elements: Ukiyo-e works often featured strong decorative qualities, with artists using various patterns and decorative elements.\n\nRealistic Portrayal: Ukiyo-e art focused on depicting human figures, especially beautiful women, with careful attention to posture, expression, and clothing.\n\nMultilayered Perspective: Ukiyo-e works often employed multilayered perspective effects to create depth and dimensionality.\n\nDuring the Edo period, ukiyo-e art became widely spread and loved, mainly due to its vivid depiction style, colorful presentation, and popular themes. The urbanization process and prosperous commercial economy of the Edo period also provided favorable conditions for the development of ukiyo-e art.

The Master said: \"Is it not pleasant to learn with constant practice? Is it not delightful to have friends coming from afar? Is it not gentlemanly not to take offense when others fail to appreciate your abilities?\"\n\nTranslation: Learning requires constant review to master. Learning knowledge and reviewing it regularly is a pleasant thing. (This addresses both learning methods and attitude.) Having like-minded people come from afar to discuss matters is a joy. Not harboring resentment when others don't understand you is the mark of a gentleman. (This speaks to personal cultivation.)\n\n2. Zengzi said: \"I examine myself daily on three points: whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful; whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere; whether I may have not mastered what I have been taught.\"\n\n3. The Master said: \"If by reviewing the old, one gains new knowledge, one is fit to be a teacher.\"\n\n4. The Master said: \"Learning without thinking is confusing; thinking without learning is dangerous.\"\n\nAnalysis: This explains the dialectical relationship between learning and thinking, and is about learning methods.\n\n5. The Master said: \"You, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, say that you know it; when you do not know a thing, admit that you do not know it. This is knowledge.\"\n\n6. The Master said: \"When we see men of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see men of contrary character, we should examine ourselves.\"\n\n7. The Master said: \"Among any three people walking, I will find something to learn from. Choose what is good in them and follow it, and what is not good and change it in yourself.\"\n\n8. Zengzi said: \"A scholar cannot but be strong and resolute, for his burden is heavy and his course is long. Perfect virtue is the burden he considers his own - is it not heavy? Only with death does his course end - is it not long?\"\n\n9. Only after the cold season sets in do we know that the pine and cypress are the last to lose their leaves.\n\n10.

In the teacher's eyes, you are an intelligent student who makes brilliant contributions in every class. You study diligently, have beautiful handwriting, and usually complete assignments accurately. However, recently, you've become a bit relaxed in your studies and less careful with homework. I hope you can correct these shortcomings, maintain higher standards for yourself, and be a good role model for your classmates. You will become even more excellent with effort!\n\n2. Looking at your big head and bright eyes, the teacher sees you as a clever and lovely boy. Teachers and classmates all enjoy hearing your stories - they're so engaging that everyone applauds. You're also a well-mannered child. Your homework has indeed improved, though you sometimes still procrastinate. If you can complete your assignments on time, your classmates and teachers will like you even more.\n\n3. In the teacher's eyes, you are a clever but mischievous student. Your academic performance is average, and you lack motivation. If you applied your intelligence to studying, you would certainly excel. Sometimes you misuse your cleverness, which is troubling. The teacher feels you're not as good as before, spending too much time thinking about play. Your grades won't improve this way. Hope you can clear your mind, strive for progress, and work hard to catch up with and surpass others.\n\nCommon Error Statistics:\nSpelling errors are the biggest point-losers! Big data shows that \"misspellings\" cause the most point deductions in compositions! Spelling errors account for 34.97% of all errors, with word spelling, capitalization, and punctuation errors ranking top three. Word basics are fundamental, and spelling mistakes are elementary errors that easily give examiners a bad first impression! While multiple choice questions make up the majority of English tests, students rarely practice spelling verification beyond classroom \"dictation.\"\n\nSentence errors cannot be ignored! Data shows that \"sentence errors\" follow \"spelling errors,\" accounting for 32.18%. Sentence errors include subject-verb agreement, missing elements, redundancy, voice, and tense errors.\n\nVocabulary challenges need addressing! Vocabulary errors rank third in English composition point deductions, accounting for 22.88%. Among vocabulary errors, verbs, nouns, and part of speech misuse rank top three, followed by pronouns, articles, prepositions, adjectives, conjunctions, and adverbs.\n(1) Verb errors: Present participle and verb combination misuse occur frequently.\n(2) Noun errors: Most common are countability and singular/plural form errors.\n(3) Part of speech misuse\n\nCollocation errors are significant! Collocation errors rank fourth in composition point deductions, accounting for 9.96%, mainly in \"idiom\" usage. Data shows that high-scoring compositions (80-100 points) mainly have collocation and sentence errors, while low-scoring ones (60-80 points) primarily show spelling and vocabulary errors.\n\nCorrection Marking Symbols:\n1. Use red pen for corrections, write neatly and standardly, mark grades and date in English.\n2. For corrected errors, students should circle the original red X with a different color to indicate proper correction.\n3. Mark grades (A, B, C) in the \"assessment\" box at top right of each classroom workbook page. Grades can be subdivided into A+, A, A-, etc.\n4. For lower grades, encourage using positive phrases like \"Excellent,\" \"Cool,\" \"Very good\" instead of rigid \"ABC\" grades to maintain interest.\n5. Use encouraging phrases like \"Good! Great!

Knowledge and Skills:\n(1) Through teaching, help students understand that plant growth requires light\n(2) Help students understand that leaves contain chlorophyll\n(3) Understand that photosynthesis produces oxygen and nutrients\n\n2. Process and Methods:\nGuide students through reading and watching experimental videos to understand leaf photosynthesis and its significance for humans and animals.\n\n3. Emotional Attitude and Values:\nFurther clarify the close relationship between humans, animals, and green plants in the biosphere, develop feelings of protecting plants and environment, understand the history of photosynthesis research, help students appreciate the rigor and long-term nature of scientific research, and improve students' scientific literacy.\n\nAnalysis of Student Situation\nAfter deepening elementary science learning, sixth-grade students are interested in science courses. However, science textbook content is diverse, covering physics, chemistry, biology, and geography, making it challenging for students. Students particularly enjoy experiments, but rural schools lack experimental equipment due to poor teaching conditions. Despite this, students maintain strong learning motivation due to their interest, resulting in good science performance.\n\nKey Points and Difficulties\nKey Points:\n1. Understanding the meaning of plant photosynthesis\n2. Understanding experimental settings, conditions, and materials for photosynthesis\n\nDifficulties:\nControl of experimental variables and understanding the significance of photosynthesis\n\nTeaching Activities\nActivity 1 [Introduction]\nQuestion: How do seeds grow into tall trees, and how do delicious fruits grow?\n\nI.

培优体系介绍】如同我们小学的十二级一样，初中有《领先中考培优课程》六级体系。六级体系是学而思教育专家团队经过5年中考培优经验的积累和沉淀，在2010年推出的完整的中考数学知识体系。它结合北京现行的主流教学进度，又有部分延伸和拓展。【解读六级体系特点】一、六级体系是个封闭的整体，每个学期都有严密的课程规划，环环相扣紧密联系。二、寒、暑假期不在是预习课，而是隶属于六级体系中的一环，等价于春秋季课程。三、春、秋季不在回顾之前的知识，完全按照六级体系继续延伸，学习新的知识点。【整体规划】\n《领先中考培优课程》六级体系\n年级\n暑假\n秋季\n寒假\n春季\n初一年级\n一级上\n一级下\n二级上\n二级下\n初二年级\n三级上\n三级下\n四级上\n四级下\n\n【横向对比】（以初一寒假和春季班做对比）\n初一数学寒假-->春季大纲对比\n寒假\n学习内容\n春季\n学习内容\n第一讲\n平行线的性质和判定（图形8级）难度：★★★\n第1讲\n平行线的构造与应用（图形9级）难度：★★★★\n第二讲\n三角形的认识（三角形1级）难度：★★☆\n第3、4讲\n三角形两大模型（三角形2级）三角形三大专题（三角形3级）难度★★★☆\n第三讲\n复杂二元一次方程组（方程5级）难度★★★☆\n第5、6讲\n含参方程组（方程6级）二元一次方程的应用（方程7级）难度★★★★\n第四讲\n含参不等式（不等式2级）难度★★★☆\n第7、8讲\n不等式应用（不等式3级）方程与不等式综合（不等式4级）难度★★★★★\n第五讲\n平面直角坐标系认识初步（函数1级）难度★★☆\n第2讲\n平面直角坐标系中的变换（函数2级）难度★★★☆\n第六讲\n统计与知识回顾（统计1级）难度★★★\n第10至13讲\n整式的乘法公式及相关全等三角形及相关难度★★★★★\n第七讲\n综合检测\n第14、15讲\n综合检测及名校真题点拨\n\n【纵向对比】（以初一寒假学的方程为例）\n方程\n标题\n级别\n时期\n一元一次方程初步\n方程1级\n初一暑假\n二元一次方程组的概念及基本解法\n方程2级\n初一暑假\n含参一元一次方程的解法\n方程3级\n初一秋季\n方程中的设元\n方程4级\n初一秋季\n复杂二元一次方程组\n方程5级\n初一寒假\n含参方程组\n方程6级\n初一春季\n二元一次方程的应用\n方程7级\n初一春季\n分式方程\n方程8级\n初二秋季\n一元二次方程认识初步\n方程9级\n初二寒假\n一元二次方程的常用解法及判别式\n方程10级\n初二寒假\n解特殊方程\n方程11级\n初二春季\n特殊根问题\n方程12级\n初二春季\n根系关系与应用题\n方程13级\n初二春季\n【小升初衔接班介绍】【10次课学完初一-----小升初衔接班】初中与小学最大的不同在于初中非常重视基础，重视解题的逻辑性与严密性，而这些学习习惯恰恰孩子小学学习时候最欠缺的。所以学而思初中数学开始的第一门非常重视基础的课程就是：10次课学完初一。“10次课学完初一”是学而思的一门金牌课程，最早学习这门课程的孩子们现在正在读高三。也就是这门课程帮助过无数的孩子提前学习了初一的内容，让孩子们开学后能顺利适应初中的学习，有一个良好的开始。\n“10次课学完初一”教学大纲\n第一讲\n有理数之六大必考概念\n第二讲\n有理数之四则运算\n第三讲\n科学计数法及有理数的混合运算\n第四讲\n整式的概念及加减法运算\n第五讲\n一元一次方程的解法及应用\n第六件\n二元一次方程组\n第七讲\n不等式（组）解法\n第八讲\n几何初步之线段、直线、射线与角的相关概念及运算\n第九讲\n几何初步之证明与推理\n第十讲\n几何初步之证明与推理\n【联赛竞赛预备班】在学完10次课的基础上，如果孩子愿意走联赛、竞赛路线，可以参加联赛竞赛预备班的学习。上课之前需要参加“联赛竞赛选拔考试”，时间为2011年6月18日。考试通过的孩子，会参加联赛竞赛预备班。课程结束后会参加联赛竞赛班选拔考试，考试通过后可以选择走联赛路线或竞赛路线。\n1、没有最好的班次，只有最适合孩子的班次\n　　超常班是很多孩子和家长所向往的，但并不意味着所有孩子都适合超常班的学习。最主要的，是根据孩子现有的能力，选择合适的班次。做个可能不太恰当的比喻，就像开车一样，在合适的速度选择合适的档位，才能最快的加速。如果一味的选择较高的档位，不单加速慢还会毁车。学习奥数也一样，只有在合适的班次，才能保证学习效果。反之，一方面不能保证学习效果，还会影响孩子的学习兴趣。\n　　2、公平的竞争机制更有利于孩子的成长\n　　超常班是牛孩的聚集地，能够考入超常班是很多孩子和家长的期望，但没有绝对的牛孩，某一次考试代表不了成功与失败，小升初才是我们最终的战场。我们要给超常班一个明确的定位：“他并不是光环，而是给更适合的孩子提供更合适的学习空间”。“他并不是温床，而是给孩子们提高一个有利成长的公平竞争机制”。在不断竞争中孩子有目标、有动力、有劲头，不骄傲、不放弃。在学习的过程中通过不断的竞争享受学习带来的快乐，为小升初做好充足的准备\n\n\n\n海报要求：1)字数控制在400-500字左右；2)需要突出我校资深教师团队(均为重点高校数学系毕业，有5年以上教学经验)和往期学员在奥数竞赛中的优异成绩；3)文风要亲和有活力，适合家长阅读，传递专业可信赖的形象；希望通过这份文案吸引家长关注并报名咨询。",

Gazing at the star-studded sky, I would curiously imagine my beautiful future. The moon would stare at me dreamily, and the stars would keep winking at me, gradually drawing me into deep thought... As I grew older, I preferred staying by the window on rainy days, watching the drizzling rain outside, closing my eyes to feel the pleasant sensation of cool breeze on my face, reminiscing about childhood fun, with a slight smile appearing on my lips.\n\nSince childhood, I've loved rainy days, and particularly loved going out without an umbrella in the rain. Whenever the weather granted my wish (when it rained), I would quietly sit in the classroom, not going anywhere, sometimes doing homework when bored. After a while, I would see that familiar figure with that bright red umbrella at the classroom door. This is why I loved rainy days and going without an umbrella. Father would habitually open the red umbrella, then hold me close, taking my small hand in his large one as we strolled in the rain. Along the way, I would constantly tell father about the interesting things that happened during the day, whether I was praised or criticized. Those were my happiest moments.\n\nAs the years steadily added their rings, everything in the world changed at time's command. And I, too, was slowly growing up. The heavy schoolwork and pressure almost suffocated me, yet my grades remained mediocre. Looking at myself in the mirror, I saw no color - no bright red showing vitality, no deep black hiding potential, just gray. It occupied my sky! However, while everything else changed, I found that the joy brought by rainy days remained constant.\n\nOn another rainy day, I hadn't expected father to come pick me up, though he no longer held that once-bright red umbrella. Again under father's umbrella, with his arm around my shoulder, I seemed to sense something. Walking in step with father, I looked up at his face and noticed his graying temples, which I had never paid attention to before. Something stirred within me. At that moment, I smiled.\n\nAn umbrella shields us from the wind and rain, while father has raised another sky for my entire life and everything in it. Under the umbrella, father's love for me runs wild like ten thousand galloping horses in my heart, leaving me with paths already paved.\n\nMy sky is blue because of father, vast because of father. essay.

"这次实习，也是毕业实习，是我们即将毕业步入工作岗位前的一次重要的实践活动，我们每一名大四的学生都认识到了这次实训的重要性。所以，每个人都为此做了充足的准备。我也是如此，从大三开始我就开始为此做准备了，希望毕业后能够立足社会，希望自己能胜任自己的岗位。也是这个原因，我在整个实习期间都很努力。无论是在公司办公室期间，还是在现场，我都用自己的勤奋、好学、以及认真的态度对待每一件事情，我不怕吃苦，不怕困难，勇于去尝试，善于总结积累，乐于从挑战中学习经验，所以，我对我的实习还是比较满意的。现在，我将要把我这段时间学习、实践所得到的东西部分的描述出来，希望老师能为我的努力给予肯定，更希望老师能悉心教导，指出我的不足，我将虚心接受批评，并在之后的工作学习中努力改正，不断提高自己作为一名采访专员的专业素养!\n\n　　一、毕业实习单位简介\n\n　　西安嘉华木文化艺术传媒有限公司成立于2020年06月29日，注册地位于陕西省西安市长安区韦曲街办南长安街428号申店新村小区2504室，法定代表人为韩吉。经营范围包括一般项目：采访各类媒体热点：艺（美）术品、收藏品鉴定评估服务；文艺创作；组织文化艺术交流活动；文化娱乐经纪人服务；其他文化艺术经纪代理；娱乐性展览；摄像及视频制作服务；咨询策划服务；个人互联网直播服务；企业总部管理；企业管理；公共事业管理服务；资产评估；市场调查（不含涉外调查）；企业形象策划；市场营销策划；礼仪服务；品牌管理；广告制作；打字复印等。\n\n　　二、实习内容及过程\n\n　　我来到西安嘉华木文化艺术传媒有限公司开始了实习，职务是采访专员。作为采访员既要采访、写作，又要编辑的实践确实很能锻炼人，从刚开始的颇感不适到现在的顺其自然，这短暂却难忘的时光，我有着太多的收获。\n\n　　这次实习给我提供了一个机会和平台，使我得以将课堂所学予以运用和发挥，锻炼了自己的新闻业务技能。通过实习，使我对新闻行业和新闻工作有了更具体、更直接、更深刻的认识。实习，不仅仅是实践，更重要的是通过实践获得某种认识，从而能指导以后的实践。此外，通过实习还锻炼了我的社会活动和交往能力。\n\n　　在实习期内，我深入到各地去采访，真正的锻炼自己的采访能力，提高了自己的提问水平，锻炼了心理素质。在采访后写了很多的`新闻稿件，熟练地掌握了各种新闻文体的写法，尤其是消息和通讯的写法，包括各种新闻文体，如动态消息、综合消息、评述性消息、人物通讯、事件通讯、工作通讯、风貌通讯等，涉及到了经济、社会等各个领域。\n\n　　可以说，实习是综合能力的一次全面考验，除了考察你的专业水平和理论知识以外，还考察了你的处世态度，做人原则以及处事方法，简而言之，就是考察你是否懂得怎样做人。勤奋是首要的，到得最早走得最晚，通宵达旦这些都应该是家常便饭而不是邀功领赏的资本，因为你是实习生，你是来学习的;主动与老师的交流同样重要，不要窝在办公室里异想天开，要及时和记者沟通，善于和记者交流，要放得下面子，同样，因为你是实习生，你是来学习的;追求新闻理想，遵守新闻道德同样我们也不应忽视，应该坚决抵制诱惑，固守新闻客观真实的这一方净土同样是因为你是实习生，你是来学习的。此外，创造性地思考和大胆的实践也是专业实习过程中所应具备的素质。从生活中，主动发掘新闻线索，包括从媒体炒过的看似过时的话题中提炼新闻线索，大胆报题，勇于独立策划采写，不要怕出丑，不要怕弄巧成拙，还是因为你是实习生。\n\n　　后来渐渐多了自己采访的机会，每次的采访回来，都会有不同的问题出现，幸好同事们都很乐意帮助我，告诉我哪些地方做的不够好，需要改进，哪些地方可以做得更好。例如说，刚开始采访时，问的问题关联性不够强，不够针对，有时问问题又过于绝对，被访对象只回答是或者不是，又或者问完一个问题后没有跟进。这些问题，在课堂上老师都有强调过要避免的，听的时候好像很容易，但是到了自己真正操作的时候，经常都是遇到一些自己不熟悉的题目和采访对象，手忙脚乱，心里紧张得被访对象回答什么都记不清楚，也无法说按照他们的回答继续跟进问下去。\n\n　　后来自己总结的时候，也认为，在实习的过程中，保持平稳的心态也是很重要的，不能遇到什么自己不熟悉的采访对象时，就慌慌张张的。\n\n　　我们需要在平淡的事实中挖出吸引眼球的部分，不仅仅要靠平时的磨练，更需要对整个事件的“了如指掌”。况且是周报，无论什么新闻都不能依照日报的样式那么简单，而是应该深入调查研究，写出深度，写得深刻。\n\n　　三、实习收获\n\n　　几个月的实习使我深深体会到，要想取得较好的成绩，以下几点是我们必须做到的：\n\n　　1、真诚待人。\n\n　　作为一个采访员，而我自己本身是个相对比较内向的。不太擅长主动和别人交流打交道。在此次实习过程中我也发现了自己的不足。比如在刚开始实习的几天内。我比较怯生。面对沉默不语的尴尬。自己有责任和义务去与别人主动交流。在工作的时候同样也要积极主动地与老师交流。在今后的社会工作中。工作不再是一个人所能完成的。那是几个人或是一个团队的工作。而且你还必须去帮助别人或是接受别人的帮助已完成工作。因此你不能期望你自己一个人就能完成任务，或是看到别人有困难也不去帮。\n\n　　由于对业务的不了解以及专业知识的不熟悉。只能够在领导的安排下进行一些相对简单的工作。但是我也很积极地去帮助别人完成自己力所能及的工作。就比如在实习中,在领导没有分配任务的空暇里。我就常主动询问周围的工作人员有没有需要帮忙的。有时候别人也不好意思麻烦我。我就主动协助他们的工作。这样子不仅锻炼了自己。帮助了他人。还融洽了你与别人之间的关系。在以后的工作中人家也更乐意和你交往了。由此我深深体会到真诚的重要性，在工作中不仅要学会如何做事，更要学会如何做人，正确处理与同事之间的关系。这关系到工作的顺利开展和个人成长进步。孤芳自赏、自视清高的人很难融入大集体。\n\n　　2、踏实勤恳，勤学好问。\n\n　　到一个陌生的环境里。很多事情都不太了解。如果自己盲目去做。很可能会出问题。\n\n　　我们要抱着踏实的态度来做事。虚心点往往能得到别人的认同。我们在学校里面学习了一年的理论知识。但是实践经历却很少，真正接触新闻行业的机会不多。所以当我遇到不懂的问题的时候。我尽量多请教实习时间比较长的实习生。或者向部门老师讨教。这样。很多情况就可以很快掌握。也为自己的努力奠定了基础和提供了方向。工作时一定要一丝不苟。认真仔细。对待每一条新闻审稿一定要小心谨慎。不能出错。有时候一个失误不仅仅使你自己的工作进程受阻。还会影响广播播出的新闻质量。因此认认真真地做每一件事情就显得尤其重要。\n\n　　为了不使自己前功尽弃。我在刚开始工作的时候一定要慎之又慎,对自己的工作要十分重视。如果有必要一定要检验自己的工作结果。以确保自己的万无一失。在你对工作开始了解并熟练后。你会发现自己已能不用检验就能保证工作的质量了。而此时你也许不需要总是重复检验工作结果。但还是要对自己的工作认真对待。以免失误。\n\n　　3、在工作岗位上一定要勤于思考,不断改进工作方法,提高工作效率。\n\n　　公司的日常工作都会比较繁琐。而且几天下来也会比较枯燥。就是需要你多动脑筋。不断地想方设法改进自己的工作方法。寻找或是设计简捷的流程。提高工作效率。减少工作所需时间。实际上勤于思考在工作中是很重要的。吴老师在这方面帮了我很大的忙。他指导我在思考如何提高工作效率的同时。也自己也能够学到更多的知。掌握更多的新闻稿件写法技能。当你在较短的时间内就完成了自己的工作。你将留下更多的时间去放松。去学习。步入社会就需要了解基本礼仪。而这往往是原来作为学生不大重视的。无论是着装还是待人接物。都应该合乎礼仪。才不会影响工作的正常进行。\n\n　　四、工作存在的问题及改进措施\n\n　　1.要学会从公司人员的语言、表情、动作去看一个人的内心世界了解一个人的处世态度。只有真正接触了才了解公司其实不会像学校那么简单尽管学校也会有一些社会前兆那是还不是那么现实。起码学校不会牵涉到工资等势力因素所以最多也就是闹得内心不愉快罢了。而公司是更为复杂的很多都是皮笑肉不笑的人所以被同事笑话单纯试想如果不单纯地寄生我或许将会陷入小集团的明争暗斗之中，我何必呢？\n\n　　2.在整个的实习过程中，我深深的感觉到自己所学知识的肤浅和在实际运用中的专业知识的匮乏，刚开始的一段时间里，对一些采访工作感到无从下手，茫然不知所措，这让我感到非常的难过。在学校总以为自己学的不错，一旦接触到实际，才发现自己知道的是多么少，这时才真正领悟到“学无止境”的含义。从实习的开始到实习的深入，再到实习的结束，我进一步了解了自己，有了自己的一个理想定位，一个今后的计划打算。努力改变自己，努力提高自己，努力让自己适应，让自己发光。\n\n　　记者这个行业就像是参加一个马拉松比赛，很艰苦，奖品再丰厚也只能到了终点才能拿。起跑的快慢并不重要，在于的是你去跑的这个过程，但是在这个过程中，不会有人去帮你，是不是能胜利，都是靠你自己。\n\n　　人生也就是一场马拉松，怎么跑，都在于自己。要送给自己一个怎么样的人生，完全都是靠自己。\n\n\n\n

\n所缺少的1000-1400大卡就须要燃烧脂肪来补足（只有营养均衡的情况下才会燃烧到脂肪，不然只会消耗肌肉，比如：节食。而失去的肌肉是马上会反弹的） \n一周消耗7000-9800大卡 \n7700大卡热量=1公斤脂肪 \n一周减0.91～1.27公斤 \n所以一个月约减4～5公斤 ， \n这种减肥方法符合人体自然代谢原理，是世界公认最健康有效的减肥方法。 \n1、康宝莱是什么？ \n康宝莱是世界体重控制和营养产品开发领域的佼佼者，是美国的上市公司，有29年历史了，已在世界68个国家成功营销，1999年进入中国，每天4000万用户在使用。中国公司总部在上海莱福士广场48楼，工厂在苏州开发区。 \n2、康宝莱有效吗？ \n康宝莱是用两餐美味的奶昔代替你一天中的两餐，另一餐正常吃饭，一般一个月能减8～10斤，康宝莱营养均衡，可让您吃得饱饱，而且同时能使您更健康，皮肤更光泽。 \n3、康宝莱安全吗？ \n康宝莱产品由草本植物提练萃取的营养减肥产品，已经卖了29年了，证实绝无副作用，孕妇也可食用，适合任何希望减肥的人群。 \n4、康宝来会反弹吗？ \n康宝莱有细胞营养专利技术可使胃部平滑肌细胞活化、产生弹性、回复胃容积正常大小，使您不易暴饮暴食。而且因脂肪细胞内的脂肪已被燃烧掉，细胞恢复正常大小，代谢也就正常了，所以脂肪不易堆积，使你真正减后不反弹。 \n5、怎样使用康宝莱减肥？ \n康宝莱是代餐的，一天吃两次，一般是早晚吃，当然也可以早中吃，看个人生活习惯和实际情况。 \n蛋白饮料调制方法：用250毫升脱脂奶（约一杯，也可以用豆浆、酸奶代替）加25克蛋白粉（两大匙）搅匀。注意：一定要用冷或温的奶调制，不能太烫。 \n餐前20分钟用1～2杯水送服1～2颗纤维素片，20分钟后用一份蛋白饮料代餐饮用。 \n康宝莱蛋白混合饮料常见问题\n1、您是否尝试过多种减重的方法却还在寻觅一种更为安全有效的控制体重的方式呢？ \n使用康宝莱蛋白混合饮料控制体重不仅方便更是安全有效。精心研制的蛋白混合饮料不仅营养丰富并且还蕴含独特的成份，会让您产生饱腹感，从而不再渴望进食不健康的食物和零食。此外，它亦为您提供了维持身体健康所需的多种重要氨基酸和能让您迅速恢复体力的碳水化合物。若您希望安全而又舒适的减重或保持体形，康宝莱蛋白混合饮料将是您最佳的选择。它饮用简便，您无须计算复杂的热量，只要每天用它代替两餐即可，其余一顿正餐便可以自由选择您所喜爱的食物。这样的日常饮食已足以提供全面均衡的热量和确保您身体健康所需的营养。 \n2、您是否感到计算事物热量是一件厌烦又令人沮丧的事情呢？ \n使用康宝莱蛋白混合饮料十分简单——您无须计算复杂的热量——只要每天以蛋白混合饮料代替两餐即可，其余一顿正餐便可以自由选择您所喜爱的事物。这样的日常饮食已经足够提供全面均衡的热量和确保您身体的健康所需要的营养。 \n3、您是否经常感到饥饿，甚至在餐后仍想吃许多的零食呢？ \n蛋白混合饮料的特别成分将带给您饱腹感并提供足够的能量，使您正日精力充沛。养成健康的生活习惯很重要，每天以一杯或两次各半杯营养丰富的美味奶昔代替零食。 \n4、您是否担心减少食量会导致营养不良呢？ \n正常情况下可能会。因此成功的体重控制方案都要包括一个全面均衡的营养供应，蛋白混合饮料就是最佳的例子。 \n5、在尝试减重的过程中您是否曾经感到非常容易疲倦且时常情绪低落，甚至脾气暴躁呢？ \n常有疲倦感是因为您未补充足够的“燃料”在减重的同时也减掉了身体所必需的营养，而情绪低落则是因为您感到“缺少食物”，血糖水平忽高忽低不稳定。康宝莱蛋白混合饮料富含缓释血糖的碳水化合物，有助于调节血糖水平，维持能量水平，能使您在减重的同时拥有健康，并且精力充沛充满活力，轻松应对日常的工作，学习。如果配合康宝莱维康宝片一起服用效果更佳。 \n6、您是否感到减重时的饮食单调并对进食没有兴趣呢？ \n康宝莱蛋白混合饮料有三种口味可供选择，更有千变万化的食谱。我们的产品将使您不再感到单调和乏味。我们的食谱非常多变，在产品中加入脱脂牛奶或其他饮料混合搅拌后饮用做成各种美味奶昔。您还可以动脑筋，创制您个人的食谱。 \n7、您是否为每次减重后的体重反弹而担心呢？ \n使用康宝莱蛋白混合饮料控制体重让您不再为体重反弹而担心。您只需每天以一杯可口的奶昔代替一顿正餐，其余两顿正餐则选择健康的食物即可。只要您保持良好的生活习惯，以正确的方式继续使用康宝莱产品，健康的身体健美的体态便可以轻松的拥有。 \n8、您是否经常吃方便食品或光顾“快餐”店呢？ \n许多快餐营养价值很低，过度加工、人工添加剂过多、高脂、高糖又昂贵。如果您需要一顿真正的“快餐”，但又希望有益健康的话，请选择无可媲美、营养价值丰富的蛋白混合饮料。 \n9、您每天要花多少时间准备营养均衡的饮食呢？ \n若您的生活繁忙，没有充足的时间准备有营养的饮食，不用担心，调制蛋白混合饮料仅仅需要几分钟，简单方便而且口味极佳。 \n10、您每天都吃早餐吗？您希望保持良好的营养和拥有健康的体形吗？ \n营养专家认为早餐是经过整晚睡眠后的第一餐也是每天最重要的一餐，能为您一天的开始提供必需的能量及营养。让您一整天都精神焕发，轻松应对工作及学习。所以请不要忽略您身体对“燃料”的需求。康宝莱蛋白混合饮料，是易于调制的早餐，为您提供美味和能量的同时更能让您轻松拥有健康的体形。完美的一天从康宝莱蛋白混合饮料开始。 \n康宝莱强力大蒜素片问答\n[1]1、大蒜有哪些功效呢？ \n多年来，医学研究发现大蒜具有加强免疫系统的功效，有助于调节血脂，改善心血管功能，还可预防其他疾病的产生。 \n据营养学专业期刊“Journal of Nutrition”研究报告，连续吃28天的大蒜之后，体脂肪，体重，三酸甘油脂等肥胖成份都下降，而adrenaline和nonadrenaline则都上升，推论是因为副肾腺上升让燃烧脂肪效率更高。 \n2、要身体健康，我需要吃多少大蒜呢？ \n研究显示：每天吃两个蒜瓣就能达到最佳的效果。然而， 人们很难坚持每天食用大蒜。有了康宝莱大蒜素片，每天吃两片就可以起到同样的功效。 \n3、康宝莱的大蒜素片会留下口腔异味吗？ \n服用康宝莱强力大蒜素片是片剂状而非粉末或生蒜瓣，因此它不会留下口腔异味。 \n4、强力大蒜素片和田园蔬果中的青片有什么区别？ \n田园蔬果中的青片中大蒜素的含量要比强力大蒜素片中所含的量要高，更纯。\n帮我把这段健康减肥产品的介绍改写成短视频口播稿，要以亲身体验者的第一人称视角进行分享，其中以下关键内容点:\n-

{"index": 472, "domain1": "Advertising & Marketing", "domain2": "Product Description", "query": "Product Introduction\n\nDiapers are disposable products made from non-woven fabric, fluff pulp, super absorbent polymer, PE breathable film, and other materials. They come in two types: for infants and for adults, primarily used by babies and elderly people. Diapers consist of four layers: top layer, transfer layer, absorbent layer, and bottom layer. The top layer directly contacts the skin, receives and transfers liquid, and requires soft materials that won't irritate the skin. The transfer layer uses specialized non-woven fabric to transmit liquid from the top layer to the absorbent layer, requiring sufficient storage space and quick liquid transfer. The absorbent layer, typically made of tissue paper, fluff pulp, and absorbent resin particles, is the most crucial functional layer. The bottom layer consists of PE film, non-woven fabric, or composite layers, mainly preventing leakage.\n\nPurchasing Recommendations\n\n1. Choose products from legitimate manufacturers through official channels. Check for product standards, hygiene standards, and sanitary production licenses. Pay attention to diaper size and expiration date. Avoid products with inflated or damaged packaging to prevent contamination leading to mold or excessive microorganisms.\n\n2. Select products with good absorption, dryness, breathability, and comfort. You can test absorption by pouring a cup of water into the diaper - faster absorption and larger capacity indicate better performance. Use tissue paper to press the wet area to assess the dryness level.\n\n3. Avoid products with irritating odors. Diapers use various raw and auxiliary materials during production, such as adhesives, pulp, and elastic threads. Unpleasant or irritating smells might indicate the use of inferior materials.\n\nAdditionally, proper wearing, timely changing, and maintaining cleanliness can effectively protect users' health.Please help me write a product recommendation article for newly launched baby diapers from the perspective of a first-time mom with a 3-month-old baby.

{"index": 484, "domain1": "Academic & Engineering", "domain2": "Abstract", "query": "Please write an academic research abstract on the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with disaster risk analysis, with a length of approximately 1500 words. The abstract should highlight specific analytical tools or methods used in the combination of GIS and disaster risk analysis. The background should be explained in the context of typical global disaster cases (such as earthquakes, floods, etc.), incorporating examples to illustrate specific applications of data visualization and risk assessment. If possible, to enhance the persuasiveness of the abstract, specific analytical methods (such as machine learning, remote sensing data processing, etc.) may be mentioned.  \n\nSpecific analytical tools or methods for integrating GIS with disaster risk analysis refer to Specific analytical tools or methods for integrating GIS with disaster risk analysis:\n\nDisaster risk assessment refers to the process of quantitatively or qualitatively evaluating the probability of disaster events and the potential losses caused by them using scientific methods, in order to formulate disaster defense and emergency management measures. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are tools used for collecting, managing, analyzing, and displaying geographic spatial data, which provide visualization of spatial data and spatial analysis capabilities. This article will discuss the integrated analytical methods of GIS in disaster risk assessment.\n\nFirstly, GIS can be used to collect and manage large amounts of spatial data. In disaster risk assessment, we need to gather data on geology, climate, land use, and other aspects to understand the likelihood and potential impact of disaster events. By using GIS, we can integrate data from different sources into a single platform, facilitating data management and updates. Moreover, GIS can provide data visualization by presenting the data in the form of charts, images, and maps, making it easier to intuitively understand and analyze the data.\n\nSecondly, GIS can conduct spatial analysis to help us understand the spatial distribution of disaster events and their related factors. For example, we can use GIS tools to create heat maps or density maps of disaster occurrences to show the risk levels of different areas. Additionally, GIS can analyze remote sensing images, and by comparing remote sensing images from different periods, changes in surface features, such as river rerouting or changes in land use, can be observed, further revealing the mechanisms behind disaster events.\n\nFurthermore, GIS can be used to build and analyze models. In disaster risk assessment, we typically need to quantify the probability of disaster events and the associated losses. By using GIS, we can apply statistical methods and model algorithms to develop corresponding models and estimate and validate model parameters. For instance, we can use GIS tools to build flood models to predict the extent and depth of flooding for different probabilities; or use geological data and earthquake historical records to develop models for earthquake occurrence probabilities to assess earthquake risks.\n\nIn addition, GIS can conduct multi-source data fusion analysis. In disaster risk assessment, we often need to integrate data from various sources, such as geographic data, environmental data, economic data, etc., in order to comprehensively assess multiple aspects of disaster risk. By using GIS, we can fuse multi-source data and perform corresponding spatial analysis and model development. For example, we can combine geological information with land use data to assess landslide risks in different areas; or merge meteorological data with land use data to assess drought risks in various regions.\n\nIn conclusion, GIS plays a crucial role in disaster risk assessment. By collecting and managing large amounts of spatial data, performing spatial analysis and model building, as well as conducting multi-source data fusion analysis, GIS helps us better understand the probability and potential impact of disaster events, providing a scientific basis for formulating disaster defense and emergency management measures. In the future, with the continuous development of technology, the application of GIS in disaster risk assessment will become more widespread and in-depth. This will provide us with more spatial data and analytical tools to address the ever-changing disaster challenges..", "checklist": [{"name": "Abstract Format Adherence", "criteria_description": "Assesses how well the response follows academic abstract conventions and adheres to the requested length of approximately 1500 words.", "1-2": "Not structured as an abstract at all;

{"index": 485, "domain1": "Academic & Engineering", "domain2": "Contributions", "query": "Write a detailed academic report on the impact of quantum computing on engineering optimization algorithms, covering the following specific requirements: 1. A brief overview of the basic principles of quantum computing and its differences from traditional computers; 2. Explore the potential impact of quantum computing on the development of future engineering optimization algorithms; 3. The report should reference high-quality academic papers or research results published within the last three years (including paper titles, publication years, journal or conference names, etc.), with a word count of no less than 8,000 words. The language should be rigorous and academic, and the report must include a clear chapter structure (such as introduction, theoretical background, key technology analysis, case studies, future trends discussion, conclusion, etc.).  \nThe overview of the basic principles of quantum computing (especially in comparison with traditional computers) and the analysis of the potential of future engineering optimization (such as the practical application prospects and potential challenges of quantum computing in the engineering field) can refer to: **Overview of the Basic Principles of Quantum Computing (Especially in Comparison with Traditional Computers)**\n\nI. **Computing Principles**\n\n1. **Basic Units**\n   - Traditional computers use binary bits as the basic unit of computation. Each bit can only represent one of two states: 0 or 1. For example, in traditional logic circuits, the state of a bit determines the on/off state of the circuit or the high/low voltage levels.\n   - Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) as the basic unit of computation. Qubits have properties of superposition and entanglement, meaning they can store the states of 0, 1, or both simultaneously. Their state can be expressed as |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are complex numbers and satisfy |α|² + |β|² = 1.\n\n2. **Basic Operations**\n   - The basic operations in traditional computers are logic gates, such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. These gates perform operations on binary bits to achieve computation. For example, the operation rule for the AND gate is (AND(0,0)=0), (AND(0,1)=0), (AND(1,0)=0), (AND(1,1)=1).\n   - The basic operations in quantum computers are quantum gates. Common gates include Pauli-X gate, Pauli-Y gate, Pauli-Z gate, and Hadamard gate. These quantum gates operate on qubits, such as (X|0⟩ = |1⟩), (X|1⟩ = |0⟩).\n\nII. **Computation Speed and Efficiency**\n\n1. **Advantages for Specific Problems**\n   - Quantum computers have a significant speed advantage when handling specific types of problems. For example, in integer factorization, Shor's algorithm can factor large prime numbers in polynomial time on a quantum computer, a task that is extremely difficult or impossible to complete within a reasonable time on traditional computers. In large-scale database search, Grover's algorithm can search for an element in an unsorted list with a time complexity that is square-root level compared to classical algorithms, providing exponential speedup in search problems.\n   - Traditional computers are more mature for handling everyday applications and commercial software. For most conventional computing tasks, such as word processing, simple data calculations, and web browsing, traditional computers can process these tasks quickly and effectively, as these do not require complex parallel computing but depend more on system stability and usability.\n\n2. **Parallel Computing Capability**\n   - Quantum computers, based on the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can perform a large number of computations simultaneously. The superposition state of qubits allows quantum computers to process multiple states at the same time, theoretically enabling parallel computation and significantly improving computing efficiency.\n   - Traditional computers must process information sequentially, as their basic units (bits) can only represent a single state at any given time. Thus, traditional computers are relatively inefficient when faced with problems that require extensive parallel computing.\n\nIII. **Applicable Problem Types**\n\n1. **Problems Suitable for Quantum Computers**\n   - Quantum computing is well-suited for complex optimization problems, such as scheduling and optimization issues in industries like manufacturing, transportation, and energy. In the field of chemistry, quantum computers can accelerate quantum chemical simulations to predict the behavior of chemical reactions, aiding in drug development and other tasks. In cryptography, quantum computing can break existing encryption algorithms (such as RSA), as well as be used to design more secure encryption algorithms. Furthermore, in big data processing and machine learning, quantum computers can play an important role in certain scenarios, such as quantum support vector machines (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN) to accelerate machine learning and artificial intelligence development.\n   \n2. **Problems Suitable for Traditional Computers**\n   - Traditional computers excel in handling computational tasks related to everyday office software, such as text layout in word processing software, spreadsheet calculations, and simple database management tasks like data querying and storage. In commercial software, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and other routine operations, traditional computers meet the requirements well due to their stability and mature technical architecture.\n\nIV. **Hardware Requirements and Stability**\n\n1. **Hardware Requirements**\n   - Quantum computers have extremely stringent hardware requirements. Qubits are very sensitive and easily affected by external interference, so they typically need to operate in extremely low-temperature environments to prevent quantum decoherence. This means quantum computers require complex cooling systems and have very high precision and stability requirements for hardware. They also require specialized maintenance techniques and equipment.\n   - Traditional computers have relatively stable hardware and operate in less demanding environments. Ordinary computers can function normally at room temperature, and hardware manufacturing and maintenance technologies are relatively mature, not requiring the specialized environmental control and high-end maintenance equipment needed for quantum computers.\n\n2. **Stability**\n   - Quantum computers face the issue of quantum decoherence, which can affect the accuracy and stability of computations. Quantum states are easily influenced by external factors, leading to changes that result in errors in computation.\n   - Traditional computers are relatively stable, with a low probability of hardware failure in normal operating environments. Additionally, software error correction mechanisms and system recovery methods are well-developed.\n\nV. **Technology Development Status and Future Prospects**\n\n1. **Current Development Status**\n   - Despite the immense potential, quantum computing is still in the early stages of development. The stability and reliability of quantum computers have not yet reached a level suitable for commercial applications. Scientists are still actively researching how to address quantum bit decoherence and how to improve the actual computing power of quantum computers. Although there have been some experimental breakthroughs, the widespread application of quantum computing technology will require more time and research.\n   - Traditional computer technology is already highly mature and widely applied across various fields, from personal computers to large data centers, and from home entertainment to enterprise office systems. The hardware, software, and network technologies of traditional computers have formed a complete industrial ecosystem.\n\n2. **Future Prospects**\n   - For quantum computers, the future will involve continued development to enhance their computing capabilities and stability. Research into quantum algorithms will also continue to discover more efficient and broader applications. Furthermore, quantum computing and traditional computing will continue to converge, improving computational performance and solving complex problems, which will require interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.\n   - Traditional computers will continue to evolve in areas such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, data mining, and big data processing. For instance, accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs in high-performance computing will further improve computational power and efficiency. In artificial intelligence, deep learning and neural networks will continue to improve their performance and applications, while data mining and big data processing technologies will evolve to meet the increasing demand for data processing and analysis.\n\n**Future Engineering Optimization Potential Analysis (Practical Applications and Challenges of Quantum Computing in the Engineering Field)**\n\nQuantum computing, as a cutting-edge technology, holds immense potential for development. With continuous technological progress, the future development of quantum computing may manifest in several areas:\n\n1. **Mainstream Commercialization**: Currently, quantum computing is still in the research and development phase and has not been widely applied in commercial fields. However, it is predicted that as the technology matures and commercialization advances, quantum computing will become mainstream across industries, improving computing efficiency and convenience.\n\n2. **Quantum Communication**: Due to the superior security features of quantum computing, it may be applied in areas such as financial transactions, government sectors, and military security in the future, enhancing communication security.\n\n3. **Solving Algorithmic Challenges**: Quantum computing can solve algorithmic problems more rapidly in fields like big data analysis and artificial intelligence, thus having a significant impact on these areas and opening up new technological frontiers.\n\n4. **High-Performance Computing and Simulation**: Quantum computing will create new possibilities in computer simulation and modeling, simulating complex molecular structures and chemical reaction processes, greatly advancing fields like materials science and drug development.\n\nIn summary, as quantum computing technology continues to advance, its impact will span various fields. The future development trend of quantum computing is highly anticipated and will undoubtedly lead to a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation.", "checklist": [{"name": "Academic Rigor and Structure", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the report's academic quality, structure adherence, and scholarly organization as specified in the query requirements.", "1-2": "Completely lacks academic tone and structure.

Please give special emphasis to the specific implementation plan and technical path for the AI stock selection strategy.  \nRelevant policies and regulations in the fintech field and user behavior research reports on the stock market can be referenced: Relevant policies and regulations in the fintech field:  \nMinistry of Public Security's regulations on internet finance  \nThe Ministry of Public Security's regulations on internet finance mainly involve aspects such as network security, financial order maintenance, and the crackdown on related criminal activities. Below is a detailed explanation of the relevant legal provisions:\n\n1. **Network security provisions**  \n   1.1 **Responsibility of individuals and organizations using the internet**:  \n   According to Article 46 of the *Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China*, any individual or organization must take responsibility for their actions when using the internet. They must not establish websites, communication groups, or other platforms for fraudulent activities, teaching criminal methods, making or selling prohibited items, controlled items, or engaging in other illegal or criminal activities, nor can they use the internet to release information related to such activities.  \n   1.2 **Management responsibility of network operators**:  \n   According to Article 47 of the *Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China*, network operators should strengthen the management of information published by their users. If they discover information that is prohibited from being published or transmitted by laws or administrative regulations, they must immediately stop transmission, take measures to eliminate it, prevent further spread, retain relevant records, and report to the relevant authorities.  \n   1.3 **Security requirements for electronic information transmission and application software**:  \n   According to Article 48 of the *Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China*, any electronic information transmitted or application software provided by individuals or organizations must not contain malicious programs or include information that is prohibited by laws or administrative regulations from being published or transmitted. Violators will be held legally responsible under Article 60 of this law.  \n\n2. **Financial order maintenance provisions**  \n   2.1 **Punishment for illegal public deposit solicitation**:  \n   According to Article 176 of the *Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China*, those who illegally solicit public deposits or engage in disguised forms of public deposit solicitation, disturbing the financial order, will face a prison sentence of up to three years or detention, and/or fines. Those with significant amounts or other severe circumstances will face harsher punishments.  \n   2.2 **Punishment for illegal fundraising**:  \n   According to Article 192 of the *Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China*, those who illegally raise funds with the intent of unlawful possession, using fraudulent methods, and raising a large amount of money, will face a prison sentence of 3 to 7 years, along with fines. If the amount is enormous or there are other serious circumstances, the person may face a longer prison sentence or even life imprisonment, as well as fines or confiscation of property.\n\n3. **Summary**  \n   The Ministry of Public Security's regulations on internet finance are primarily focused on maintaining network security and financial order. Through relevant provisions in the *Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China*, the behaviors of individuals and organizations on the internet are regulated, and the management responsibilities of network operators are clearly defined. At the same time, the *Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China* clearly stipulates penalties for financial crimes such as illegal public deposit solicitation and illegal fundraising. These legal provisions together form the legal foundation for the Ministry of Public Security's supervision and crackdown on criminal activities in internet finance.\n\n**Research Report on Stock Market User Behavior**  \nThe report shows that the pace at which individual investors are entering the A-share market continues to accelerate. Currently, the number of individual investors in the A-share market has exceeded 175 million. This means that one in every ten people in China has opened an A-share account. However, using this number to represent the number of people participating in investments is not entirely accurate, as many of these accounts are inactive.  \nMen account for 78%, and women account for 22%. Men remain the main force in A-share investments, with the male-to-female ratio around 8:2, which is quite similar to our daily experience. Individuals between 24 and 30 years old account for nearly 30%, while those under 24 who have money are relatively rare, and those with money do not necessarily invest in stocks. People aged 30-40 make up 36%, and those over 40 account for about 25%. This means that individuals in the 30-40 age range, generally middle-aged, are the main force behind stock market investments. This group tends to have stable careers and families, some spare money, and some financial knowledge, and they aim to prevent their money from losing value by investing to earn profits.  \nInvestors are getting younger, and their educational backgrounds are improving. Among investors born after 1990, 50% have a bachelor's degree or higher. Among investors born in the 1980s, this percentage is 44%. Among investors born in the 1970s, the proportion is 38%. Meanwhile, nearly half of investors born in the 1950s have a high school education or lower.  \nInvestors from first-tier and super-first-tier cities account for 69%. Cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou, as well as Chengdu, are the top five cities in terms of investor distribution. Even Hangzhou, which has risen to a new first-tier city, ranks fourth.  \n26% of investors have less than 100,000 yuan, 30% fall into the 100,000-300,000 yuan range, and 15% have more than 1 million yuan. 28% of households are willing to allocate 10%-30% of their assets for A-share investment. 23% of households are willing to allocate 30%-50% for investment. 13% of households are willing to invest 70% of their assets, which suggests a high-risk, high-reward approach. However, this is not recommended for the average investor. It is always better to invest within one's financial means and create a solid asset allocation plan.  \nA-shares, mutual funds, real estate, and bank savings are the top four investment channels for investors. 41% of people are willing to invest in A-shares, 15% are willing to buy mutual funds, 9% want to invest in real estate, and 8% are interested in bank savings. According to interviews, 43% of post-90s investors prefer mutual funds. In contrast, investors born in the 1950s prefer bank savings-based financial products. This reflects the different growing environments across generations. Older generations tend to prefer conservative savings, while younger people are more aggressive and confident in managing their wealth.  \nOver 60% of investors had positive returns in 2020. Only 12.5% experienced losses of more than 20%.  \nOnly 24% of investors are willing to hold stocks for more than six months. About 30% can only stick with their investments for 1-3 months, and 34% of people trade stocks frequently within a month. This shows that A-share investors have not yet developed good investment habits. Many are more focused on short-term trades.  \nMore than 70% of investors have not sought paid investment consultations. Only 12% would pay for investment education or professional advice. This indicates that most of the A-share investment market is dominated by self-directed investors, creating significant opportunities for institutions and professional investors to profit.", "checklist": [{"name": "Comprehensiveness of Product Plan", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the extent to which the response addresses all required sections of the product plan with sufficient depth and detail, especially meeting the 5000-word minimum requirement.", "1-2": "Critical omission of multiple required sections;

After initial review by the legal advisors of the Yueyang Municipal Government, collective review by the Municipal Judicial Bureau, and approval by the Municipal Government, nine cases were selected and announced to the public as typical administrative law enforcement cases for 2022, including the case of administrative permission for the Yueyang Sports Center Stadium and the case of administrative punishment for Li for posting fishing in a protected aquatic biological area on the \"Douyin\" platform.\n\nThe nine typical cases released this time focus on key administrative law enforcement areas such as fire safety, agriculture and rural affairs, market supervision, urban management, forestry, transportation, ecological environment, and culture, tourism, and broadcasting. These cases include both administrative licensing and administrative penalty cases, traditional cases of administrative penalties, as well as new types of illegal activities involving the internet. They also include severe cases and cases demonstrating a more lenient approach, such as the first offense not being penalized. These cases are characterized by a clear focus on balancing severity and leniency, integrating legal principles, and achieving both effective legal and social results. They are representative and exemplary.\n\n**Case 1: Administrative License Case of Yueyang Sports Center Stadium**\nOn September 2, 2022, a company in Yueyang submitted an application to the Yueyang Fire Rescue Brigade for a fire safety inspection before the public gathering place was put into use. The Yueyang Sports Center Stadium hosted the opening ceremony and some events of the 14th Hunan Provincial Games and the Disabled Games in 2022. The Yueyang Fire Rescue Brigade, in accordance with the principle of ensuring the safety of major events, organized a team of fire technical experts to provide technical guidance and assistance, optimizing the process, proactively serving, and effectively balancing the aesthetic transparency of the venue with fire safety. On September 9, 2022, in accordance with Article 15 of the Fire Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, the stadium passed the fire safety inspection and obtained the fire administrative license with the fastest speed, optimal plan, and best benefits.\n\n**Case 2: Administrative Penalty Case for Li's Fishing in an Aquatic Biological Protection Zone on \"Douyin\"**\nOn May 23, 2022, law enforcement officers from the Pingjiang County Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs discovered a video on the \"Douyin\" platform, showing fishing in the national aquatic biological protection zone of the Miluo River's Pingjiang section, targeting species such as the Chinese perch and yellow catfish. With the help of the Pingjiang County Cybersecurity Office, Public Security Bureau, and China Telecom Pingjiang Branch, the video poster was identified as Li. After investigation, it was found that Li had gone to fish in the protected area on May 22 to attract \"fans\" on social media. The law enforcement authorities fined Li, confiscating the fishing equipment based on the relevant provisions of the \"Decision on Promoting and Ensuring the Fishing Ban in the Yangtze River Basin.\"\n\n**Case 3: Administrative Penalty Case for a Gas Station Company Over Measuring Device Accuracy**\nOn August 17, 2022, the Yueyang Market Supervision Administration, in conjunction with the Municipal Public Security Department, conducted a law enforcement action and found that four fuel dispensers at a gas station company had measurement errors exceeding the allowable national error of ±0.3%. The Market Supervision Administration took legal action, confiscating one USB key, four dispenser control mainboards, and illegal earnings of over 1 million yuan, while also imposing a fine of 2,000 yuan for the violations.\n\n**Case 4: Illegal Occupation of Forest Land by Different Entities at the Same Location**\nIn March 2022, law enforcement officers from the Miluo City Forestry Bureau discovered that a construction company had illegally occupied 0.54 hectares of forest land in Yutan Village, Miluo City, during construction from January to June 2020. Afterward, the land was used to dump construction waste, destroying the vegetation and production conditions. In June, due to the large amount of waste, a safety hazard was created, and the responsible person employed a worker to modify the land. The company was fined 140,000 yuan for damaging forest conditions, while the person responsible for the modification was not penalized for the safety work.\n\n**Case 5: Administrative Penalty Case for Chen's Unauthorized Online Ride-Hailing Business**\nOn April 18, 2022, officers from the Yueyang Transportation Bureau discovered that Chen, using a private car, was charging a fare of 26.9 yuan for a ride from Xinkai Town to Yueyang East Station, without having obtained the required online ride-hailing license. However, as the fare was significantly below the standard operating vehicle charge, and the transportation was conducted in a non-commercial manner, no administrative penalty was imposed. This reflects a cautious and inclusive approach to emerging business models and addresses the current ambiguity in the legal classification of ride-sharing services.\n\n**Case 6: Administrative Penalty Case for a Wood Processing Factory Discharging Polluted Water**\nIn June 2022, officers from the Yueyang Ecological Environment Bureau used drone technology to detect that a wood processing factory was spraying oil-water separation wastewater onto products, which then mixed with rainwater and polluted a nearby water pit. The factory was fined 100,000 yuan for environmental violations, and the case was referred to the police, who detained the responsible individuals, sending a strong deterrent signal to other enterprises regarding environmental protection.\n\n**Case 7: Administrative Penalty Case for He's Illegal Broadcasting of Foreign Channels**\nOn February 8, 2022, the Yueyang Cultural Market Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Team discovered that He had rented a cloud server and established a website that provided illegal radio streaming services, which included politically sensitive content. The authorities fined He 30,000 yuan and ordered a correction. This was the first case of its kind in Yueyang, highlighting the city's efforts to manage foreign media broadcasts.\n\n**Case 8: Administrative Penalty Case for a Real Estate Company Avoiding Bidding Procedures**\nOn October 20, 2022, the Yueyang Urban Management and Comprehensive Law Enforcement Bureau received a tip-off about a real estate developer illegally bypassing the bidding process for a property project in Yueyang. The company had illegally outsourced the foundation pit support pile project before the bidding process, and was fined over 20,000 yuan for the violation.\n\n**Case 9: Administrative Penalty Case for Illegal Hunting of Wildlife for Food**\nOn December 21, 2021, the Linxiang Forestry Bureau received a case transfer from the Linxiang Forest Public Security Bureau. Two individuals were found attempting to illegally hunt wildlife for food in the Changjiang River embankment area. They were fined 3,500 yuan each for the offense. Despite not catching any wildlife, their actions still constituted illegal hunting, and the law enforcement authorities balanced strict law enforcement with a degree of leniency.\n\n**Regulatory Content:**\n\nThe content of government administration according to law mainly includes the following aspects:\n\n1. **Legality of Administrative Subjects**\n   The first requirement of administrative law enforcement is that the agencies and organizations exercising administrative power must meet the legal qualifications, status, and organizational conditions. This means that administrative bodies must be legally established, have appropriate administrative power, and exercise that power within the legal boundaries.\n\n2. **Legality of the Exercise of Administrative Power**\n   When exercising power, administrative agencies must strictly follow the laws and regulations. This includes that administrative actions must be based on clear legal provisions, administrative decisions must conform to the law, and administrative procedures must follow the prescribed steps. For example, Article 44 of the Administrative Penalty Law of the People's Republic of China states that before imposing an administrative penalty, the administrative agency must inform the parties involved of the content, facts, reasons, and legal basis of the intended penalty, as well as the right to make statements, defend themselves, and request a hearing.\n\n3. **Equivalence of Rights and Responsibilities, and Supervision**\n   Administrative agencies, while enjoying administrative powers, must also bear corresponding responsibilities. If their actions are illegal or improper, they must bear legal liability. At the same time, their actions are subject to legal and social supervision to ensure they are performing their duties according to law. Article 5 of the Supervision Law of the People's Republic of China states that national supervisory work strictly follows the Constitution and laws, basing decisions on facts and law, ensuring the equivalence of rights and responsibilities, and being subject to rigorous supervision.\n\nIn summary, government administration according to law includes ensuring the legality of administrative subjects, the legality of the exercise of administrative power, and the equivalence of rights and responsibilities, along with supervision. These requirements form the basic framework for rule-of-law governance, aimed at ensuring that administrative agencies exercise power within the boundaries of the law, protecting social order and public interest.", "checklist": [{"name": "Adherence to Outlined Structure", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response follows the six-part outline specified in the query, including introduction, definition, core principles, value to governance, public participation, and conclusion, with appropriate emphasis on each section.", "1-2": "Completely disregards the required outline structure;

{"index": 532, "domain1": "Literature & Arts", "domain2": "Fan Fiction", "query": "The typical problems of elderly people using smart devices:\n\nOn March 14, in the home appliance section of a shopping mall in Beijing's Dongcheng District, 78-year-old Wang Gui Fen (pseudonym) was looking for a rice cooker. Listening to the salesperson's introduction of the various features of the product, Wang quickly shook her head, saying, \"The one my children bought at home is just like this, with more than a dozen buttons. I don’t even know how to use it, and in the end, the rice didn’t cook properly!\" \n\nAs home appliances become \"smarter\" and improve people's quality of life, they have also left some elderly people at a loss. \n\nIn 2023, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the \"Work Plan for Promoting the High-Quality Development of Digital Technology for Elderly People,\" focusing on bridging the \"digital divide\" for the elderly. It was clearly stated that by the end of 2025, the government will guide and support enterprises to develop and launch more than 100 smart products with features suitable for the elderly, covering categories such as smartphones, televisions, speakers, wristbands, and more.\n\nMany elderly people hope that more appliances suitable for their needs will be launched, products that are simple and easy to use.\n\n1. Bought it but can’t use it! \"It asks for a membership as soon as you turn it on, and I can’t find the channels\"\n\nDuring the Spring Festival holiday, Jiang Zhao (pseudonym), who works in Beijing, returned to her hometown in Hebei and found that the smart TV she bought for her parents had not only been covered with a TV cover but had also not been turned on for a long time. Jiang Zhao’s mother told her, \"As soon as you turn it on, it asks for a membership, and I can’t find the normal channels. It hasn’t been turned on in months.\" When she picked up the remote control and tried to use it, Jiang Zhao realized that her impression of the TV was still stuck in the time when she was a child watching color TVs, where you could just press the power button on the remote and find various channels. But today, things aren’t like that anymore. \n\nWhile they were talking, Jiang Zhao’s father brought another remote control, which had been given to them when the TV was installed, but they had never used it. After searching on Baidu for a while, Jiang Zhao finally figured out how to watch TV: one remote was used to turn the TV on, and after entering the interface, another remote was needed to point at the set-top box in order to find the satellite channels they wanted to watch. This complicated operation overwhelmed Jiang Zhao, and for her parents, it was undoubtedly even harder. \"I just want a TV that works as soon as you turn it on. We don’t need such complicated features,\" Jiang Zhao’s mother sighed.\n\nLike Jiang Zhao's parents, many elderly people face similar confusion. \n\nA report on elderly-friendly televisions published by China’s Home Appliance Network previously revealed that many elderly people face difficulties when using smart TVs. The top three problems they encounter are: \"Can’t directly access the TV program they want to watch after turning on the TV,\" \"Too many devices (set-top boxes, TVs) and they don’t know how to switch between them,\" and \"The operation is too complicated, and they don’t know how to find the content they want to watch.\" When they encounter difficulties, 40.3% of the respondents say they \"ask their children,\" and as many as 27.2% choose to \"give up directly and stop watching.\"\n\nHealth Times reporters visited several home appliance stores in Beijing and heard similar feedback. At the Suning store on Chaoyang Road in Chaoyang District, 82-year-old Guo Fang (pseudonym) told a reporter from Health Times, \"These appliances nowadays are quite complicated, especially for us elderly people.\" She had already been standing in front of the display for a while before the reporter arrived. \"Appliances should have more functions, but they shouldn’t be too complicated. The most important thing is that the commonly used functions should be clearly labeled, the font shouldn’t be too small, and the buttons shouldn’t be too many. Ideally, it should be clear at a glance without having to memorize all the steps...\" In Guo Fang’s opinion, the most important thing for an appliance is that it is reliable and durable, not to pursue fancy features. The more functions it has, the more likely it is to affect the stability and lifespan of the device itself. Microwaves that don’t have the right buttons, televisions that can’t find channels, water heaters that talk for no reason… The increasingly \"smart\" appliances have not really made life easier for elderly people.\n\n2. Needs ignored! Complex appliance functions, smart appliances confuse the elderly\n\nWi-Fi connectivity, remote control via smartphones, and multiple overlapping functions... When visiting home appliance stores, reporters from Health Times found that many of the main products on display were smart devices—smart appliances, smart washing machines, smart TVs, smart microwaves, etc.—with the main selling point being a variety of functions and high-end intelligence. \"The development of the home appliance market is mainly driven by commercial value, and elderly people have relatively weak commercial value, so the technology doesn’t specifically address their needs,\" said Dang Junwu, deputy director of the China National Committee on Aging’s research center, in an interview with Health Times. Currently, many home appliance manufacturers target the middle-aged and young demographic, who tend to prefer smart products with fashionable designs and powerful features. In contrast, elderly people often prioritize practicality and price when buying appliances. \n\nLiu Juan (pseudonym), 40 years old, lives in Chengdu with her nearly 70-year-old mother. To reduce the burden of household chores, Liu Juan purchased many smart home appliances, including a smart washing and drying machine, a robotic vacuum, and a visual door access monitoring system. \"The biggest problem with using them is that almost all appliances need to be connected to Wi-Fi and controlled remotely via a smartphone,\" Liu Juan told the reporter. When the robot vacuum runs out of battery while cleaning corners of the house, it stops working and if it gets stuck under the sofa or bed, it’s hard to find. Even when they find it, her mother, due to physical limitations, struggles to remove the vacuum and has to wait for Liu Juan to return home. Ultimately, they decided to buy a manual vacuum cleaner and do the cleaning themselves.\n\nA head of product development for an appliance company told the Health Times reporter that many smart appliances now require Wi-Fi connections, and the process of setting up the Wi-Fi itself involves a series of relatively complex steps, including choosing a network, entering a password, and confirming the connection. For elderly people who are not familiar with network settings, this can be overwhelming. Moreover, many smart appliances have multiple functions, each with its own specific settings and operation methods, which elderly people find difficult to learn and use proficiently.\n\n\"Smart home appliances are an important direction in the digital age and the development of smart technology, and while they bring convenience to people’s lives, they inevitably come with new problems,\" said Lu Jiehua, director of the National Strategy Research Center on Aging at Peking University, in an interview with Health Times. \"In the development of smart appliances, both designers and consumers tend to focus on the needs of younger generations, while the elderly often get overlooked. Bridging the 'digital divide' for the elderly has become a new challenge.\"\n\n3. R&D should be closer to elderly people’s lives! Bridging the \"digital divide\" for the elderly, allowing them to enjoy a digital life\n\nIn Dang Junwu’s view, during the development of smart homes, we should avoid equating complexity with \"intelligence\" and mistaking \"elderly-friendly\" for outdated features. In recent years, not many impressive elderly-friendly smart appliances have appeared on the market. Many products labeled as \"elderly-friendly\" do not truly meet the needs of elderly people, and many features are unnecessary and hardly used in practice.\n\n\"From the perspective of product design, this reflects a lack of human-centered logic,\" Dang Junwu said. \"Complex buttons may seem to offer a variety of choices, but in reality, many of these functions are never used. To some extent, this is a form of 'pseudo-intelligence.'\"\n\nIn his view, smart appliances should not come at the cost of ease of use. If a piece of home equipment requires a group of people to be repeatedly trained to use it, or even after repeated training, it’s still hard to use, it should not be called a smart appliance.\n\nDang Junwu explained that some countries that started earlier with elderly-friendly smart appliances focus on a \"human-centered\" approach, starting from the actual life of elderly people. For example, in some countries, designers spend time living with elderly people to better understand their real needs before starting the design process. \"Currently, most of our home appliance companies are still focused on technological logic and have not invested much effort in human-centered design.\"\n\nDang Junwu believes that elderly-friendly smart appliances should meet the following four criteria: \n\n1. Vision-friendly: As elderly people generally have poor vision, the labels on smart products should use clear and easily understandable graphics and color symbols.\n2. Simple functionality: The product should focus on stability and safety, rather than promoting dazzling feature overload.\n3. Simple operation: Considering that elderly people’s thinking and movements slow down, the product should be as simple to operate as possible.\n4. Compensating for deficiencies: Considering that elderly people may have memory loss, specific products could include reminders, such as adding a timer to pillboxes or a function that alerts when keys are left behind., based on the provided short novel, create a continuation story about the coexistence of an elderly person and an intelligent robot. The story should include the following elements:  \n\n1) Detailed depictions of daily interactions between the elderly person and the robot, including dialogue, actions, and psychological activities.  \n2) While showcasing the convenience brought by technology, the story should also highlight the importance of humanistic care and emotional resonance.  \n3) Through the interactions between the elderly person and the robot, explore ethical dilemmas in the era of human-machine coexistence, such as whether robots possess genuine emotions and the pros and cons of human over-reliance on technology.  \n4) The ending of the story should be philosophical, demonstrating both the value of technological progress and the irreplaceability of human nature.  \n5) The overall tone should be warm and sincere, with appropriate conflicts to drive the plot forward.  \n\nSuggested word count: 3,000–5,000 words.", "checklist": [{"name": "Query Comprehension", "criteria_description": "Assesses how accurately the response understands the actual query versus the background context.

{"index": 533, "domain1": "Literature & Arts", "domain2": "Plot Development", "query": "Design the plot framework of a road novel in which the protagonist, during a cross-country highway journey, encounters five strangers from different backgrounds through various coincidences. These five individuals, each representing distinct cultures, values, or social issues, form dramatic intersections and conflicts with the protagonist, gradually revealing their deeper stories.  \n\nThe plot should be outlined in chapters, with each chapter focusing on the protagonist’s interaction with one of the strangers, while maintaining an overarching theme—such as self-redemption, the search for belonging, or rebuilding trust—throughout the narrative. The writing style should be suitable for young adult readers, with delicate emotions yet a touch of humor. Vivid, cinematic scene descriptions should be incorporated into the storytelling, along with deep and realistic psychological portrayals of the characters.  \n\nThe outline should be designed with a target length of approximately 100,000 words, emphasizing coherence and layered storytelling. Additionally, special attention should be given to detailing highway scenes, allowing readers to experience the rich regional atmosphere and nomadic spirit.  \n\nRefer to the following for distinctive scenes or cultural background materials from different cross-country highway journeys: Unique scenes or cultural backgrounds in road trips across different countries:\n\nBut if you’re fortunate enough to drive on Norway’s Atlantic Road, South Africa’s Garden Route, or Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coastal Route, you’ll realize: this isn’t just an ordinary road trip, it feels like you’ve stepped into a fantasy movie!\n\nImagine this: outside your car window, it’s not just a regular view, but a stage for whales, seals, or even legends of giants. How does that sound?\n\nLet’s start with Norway’s Atlantic Road! This isn’t just any coastal road; it’s like a roller coaster that nature itself designed for you. Especially that iconic Storseisundet Bridge—don’t even think about just driving over it, just looking at its shape that seems to rush into the sea will make your heart race. Step on the gas, and you’ll feel like you’re flying, with the howling sea wind on one side and the roaring waves on the other, almost as if the sea spray could splash onto your car window at any moment. What’s even more amazing is that seals and whales could also appear beside you—truly driving “side by side” with ocean creatures.\n\nBut don’t think that only Northern Europe offers cold and bleak landscapes.\n\nTake a turn, and we’re in the warm and vibrant South Africa’s Garden Route! This isn’t a winding flower-filled road, but rather a paradise of mountains, lakes, forests, and wildlife. One moment you’re surrounded by rolling mountains, and the next, a vast blue coastline appears. Wild animals occasionally pop out to say hello—elephants, lions... all of them. The best part is that in Hermanus, you can watch whales dance up close! This place is known as “the world’s best land-based whale watching destination.” Standing on the shore, you’ll witness massive whales tumbling in the water—a scene that will leave you breathless with awe.\n\nOf course, we can’t forget the mysterious Causeway Coastal Route in Northern Ireland. This feels like stepping into a mythical world, especially with the famous Giant’s Causeway—volcanic rock columns arranged in neat formations, as if giants built a staircase for themselves. You might even feel the legendary giants sneaking a peek at you from some corner. The Gobbins Cliff Path is even more thrilling and beautiful; this trail hugs the cliffs, making you feel like you’re walking on clouds. You’ll find yourself surrounded by seabirds and dolphins, completely immersed in nature’s embrace. Just thinking about it is enough to make your heart race!\n\nAfter traveling along these three roads, you’ll notice that each one has its unique style and charm.\n\nFor example, Norway’s Atlantic Road feels like a battle of wits with nature; South Africa’s Garden Route is full of vibrant life; Northern Ireland’s Giant’s Causeway is the perfect blend of mystery and fantasy. Each road seems to tell you that the world is vast, and wonders are everywhere, and you’re just a passing observer.\n\nFinally, we can’t help but ask—what kind of scenery can truly be called beautiful? Is it Norway’s wild sea winds? South Africa’s leaping whales? Or perhaps Northern Ireland’s ancient legends? Every road gives you a different answer. Data shows that in recent years, road trips have been gaining popularity, and these uniquely scenic roads have attracted countless travelers. In the future, who knows, you may have the chance to set foot on these magical roads and experience your own moment of awe.", "checklist": [{"name": "Plot Structure and Coherence", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response structures the novel into chapters focusing on each stranger while maintaining an overarching theme.

{"index": 535, "domain1": "Literature & Arts", "domain2": "Screenplay", "query": "Write a script for a stage play set in early 20th-century Shanghai, showcasing the urban landscape under the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures. The background and true story can refer to **The Background and True Stories of Underground Revolutionary Activities in Shanghai in the Early 20th Century:**\n\nThe city had a large space, a densely packed population, and its residents were relatively unfamiliar with each other, which provided a convenient environment for constantly changing identities, moving residences, and conducting covert struggles. After the April 12th coup of 1927, the Communist Party's underground activities in Shanghai were governed by a principle, which stipulated that Party organizations should be \"socialized.\" Party organs at all levels would take the form of shops, homes, hospitals, offices, etc. The clothing, language, and activities of those living in and visiting these places had to align with public identities. A house would typically have only a husband and wife, with not too many visitors; a shop could have more visitors, and the organization's connection with foreign intelligence might be through an antique shop, which was less likely to attract suspicion. Zhou Enlai and Xiang Zhongfa’s public identities were antique dealers; Deng Xiaoping's public identity was that of a shop manager, running a tobacco and paper store on Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road. From the spring of 1931 to the winter of 1932, the secret printing house led by Mao Zemin, Qian Zhiguang, and other leaders of the Communist Party moved five times.\n\nAt that time, the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party had a secret base located at 447 Yunnan Road (now 171-173 Yunnan Middle Road), right behind the bustling Tianchan Stage. The lower floor housed a Shengli Hospital, and the upper floor had a sign reading \"Fuxing Zizhuang.\" This base was established in the winter of 1927 or early 1928 as the meeting place for the Central Committee. The owner of the Zizhuang was Xiong Jinding, and his wife was Zhu Duanshou, both from Changsha. The couple originally pretended to be husband and wife but later married for real. After the establishment of the base, the Central Political Bureau held many meetings there, and leaders such as Zhou Enlai, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, Li Weihan, Deng Xiaoping, Deng Yingchao, and Chen Geng frequently came to study and work. Li Weihan recalled:\n\nAt that time, the comrades who attended the meetings would enter the meeting room via a staircase on the west side of Tianchan Stage on Yunnan Road. Inside the room, there was a small desk under the west-facing window, where Xiaoping would take notes during the meetings. This base remained intact until after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in January 1931, without being compromised. Later, it was likely abandoned after Gu Shunzhang was arrested and betrayed in April 1931.\n\nIn such a complex society as Shanghai, family ties, regional ties, friendships, Party loyalty, national feelings, and various interests were often intertwined. This also facilitated the Communist Party's covert struggle.\n\nIn August 1929, Chen Yi, who was serving as the secretary of the Central Red Fourth Army's Front Committee, came to Shanghai to report to the Party Central Committee. To cover up his activities, he had two people accompany him: one was his elder brother Chen Mengxi, the Director of the Political Department of the Shanghai Garrison Command, and the other was his cousin, Chen Xiuhu, the supervisor and acting director of the Shanghai Longhua Arsenal's Political Department. The two helped Chen Yi get a tailored suit and a badge from the arsenal. While Chen Yi was talking with Zhou Enlai at the Xindu Hotel, Chen Xiuhu and Chen Mengxi were playing chess outside as a cover. Although both were Nationalist officials, they understood Chen Yi's political identity, yet at this moment, family ties took precedence over Party loyalty.\n\nThe most legendary figure was Yang Dengying. Yang was from Xiangshan, Guangdong, and studied in Japan in his early years. He came to Shanghai in 1919, joined the Nationalist Party in 1924, and during the Great Revolution, was a left-wing member of the Kuomintang, closely associated with Communists. He met his fellow townsman Yang Jianhong during the May 30th Movement, and they became inseparable. Later, Yang Jianhong became a confidant of Chen Lifu, which allowed Yang Dengying to become familiar with Chen Lifu. In 1928, Chen Lifu was responsible for the Kuomintang's military intelligence, and Yang Dengying became the KMT's special envoy in Shanghai. Yang Dengying had a friend, Chen Yangshan, who was a Communist Party member. Through Chen’s connections, Chen Geng and Yang Dengying established contact. Though Yang was an official in the KMT's critical departments, he had certain ideological distances from the party. Therefore, using his connections, Communist Party member Qian Zhuangfei infiltrated the KMT's military intelligence and became the private secretary of the KMT's intelligence head, Xu Enzeng. Qian Zhuangfei was able to provide the Communist Party with vital information about several defections, including those of He Jiaxing, Hao Zhihua, Dai Bingshi, Bai Xin, and Chen Weinian. These key moments and the intelligence provided were significant contributions to the Communist Party in obtaining critical KMT secrets and identifying internal traitors.\n\nThe Communist Party’s use of Du Yuesheng also reflected Shanghai's complex social fabric. In the April 12th coup of 1927, Du Yuesheng sided with the KMT and helped suppress the Communists. However, his personal advisor, Yang Du, was a Communist. Yang Du had previously been one of the \"Six Gentlemen\" of the Chao Anhui, but during the White Terror era, he joined the Communist Party. Du Yuesheng, who admired Yang's reputation, hired him as an advisor, paying him 500 yuan a month and giving him a Western-style house. Through this relationship, Yang Du provided the Communist Party with valuable intelligence. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Du Yuesheng made many contributions, including assisting the New Fourth Army with the establishment of underground supply lines and providing military supplies. He was also a close friend of Huang Yanpei, a progressive political figure who had been targeted by Chiang Kai-shek. In 1947, KMT agents planned to assassinate Huang Yanpei, but Du Yuesheng alerted him, saving his life.\n\nAs for Pan Hannian, his ability to maneuver among different people and use various relationships for covert struggles is well-known, and there is no need to elaborate further.\n\nFigures like Yang Dengying, Du Yuesheng, and Pan Hannian, who had extensive networks and were adept at navigating multiple relationships, were not unique in Shanghai. They were products of Shanghai's intricate social structure. People are complex and mutable, especially in an era of changing winds. In such a bizarre society as Shanghai, Communist Party members understood this point and utilized it to their advantage as much as possible.. The protagonist is a disillusioned poet who becomes entangled in an underground revolution, experiencing the conflict between ideals and reality. His poetry gradually becomes a tool for transmitting revolutionary messages. The script must follow the following outline:\n\n1) Prologue: Depict the social environment of Shanghai in the early 20th century, opening with a newspaper reading or a café discussion to present the protagonist's identity and predicament;\n2) Conflict: The protagonist accidentally discovers that his poetry is being used as a secret code for the underground revolution, and he begins to get involved in revolutionary events;\n3) Twist and Climax: During his cooperation with the revolutionaries, the protagonist witnesses sacrifice, betrayal, and the collapse of ideals;\n4) Conclusion: The protagonist completes a masterpiece that will last through the ages, leaving a heartfelt call to the future.\n\nThe script should portray intricate psychological activity and a tense narrative. The dialogue should be literary, while also incorporating the historical and cultural background of early 20th-century Shanghai. The overall style should balance poetry and realism, inviting the audience to contemplate the fate of individuals in the grand sweep of history.

Future Development Prospects of Education Consulting Industry\n    With the acceleration of China's urbanization process, social stability and urban security issues are gradually emerging. Education consulting technology is a key technology for infrastructure development. Therefore, with further development of social economy and information technology, the application of education consulting will become a new trend in the future.\n\n(1) Market Size Forecast for China's Education Consulting Industry\n    Education consulting technology is being increasingly applied in people's daily life and work. As China's social economy continues to develop, the demand for education consulting applications will also increase.\n\n(2) Education Consulting Enters Large-scale Promotion Phase\n    China's education consulting technology development began in the late 1990s, experiencing five stages: technology introduction - professional market introduction - technology improvement - application across various industries.\n    Currently, domestic education consulting has matured and is increasingly being promoted across various fields, expanding terminal equipment, unique services, value-added services, and other products and services. Over twenty product series cover finance, transportation, public services, social welfare, e-commerce, and security sectors, marking the arrival of comprehensive education consulting era.\n\n(3) Market Growth Points in China's Education Consulting Industry\n    According to incomplete statistics, over 50% of companies in the education consulting industry provide system integration services, while 25% of companies on the New Third Board also provide system integration services. There is still significant space for system integrators in the overall education consulting market, with potential for increased market flattening.\n    Channels, customer resources, reputation, management, service, technology, and integration capabilities are core elements for system integrators. In the education consulting industry, which heavily relies on thousands of channels and has high product homogeneity, many manufacturers can combine these elements. By leveraging their advantageous resources, they can develop into system integrators. Expanding service types and scope can enrich existing customer resources and product systems while enhancing risk resistance and competitiveness. Of course, when providing integration services, attempt to make service systems lighter and easier to operate and manage.\n\n(4) Segmented Education Consulting Products Will Have the Greatest Advantage\n    With deepening applications across industries and departments, user categories are becoming increasingly personalized and diverse. The \"large and complete\" or \"small and complete\" unified model, including industry management systems with education consulting management modules, will eventually be broken. Professional segmentation will become the overall trend for education consulting-related project construction. More links in various industry information systems can be connected as relatively independent systems and segmented markets. Transportation information systems, government information systems, e-commerce systems, social entertainment systems continue to develop and improve. Software developers will be able to win markets through in-depth research and advantages in certain segmented areas.\n\n(5) Integration Development Opportunities between Education Consulting Industry and Internet\n    The internet's impact on education consulting will be more profound in the future. Enterprises use \"Internet+\" platform technology to improve network service levels and enhance competitiveness. Education consulting e-commerce will develop rapidly. The industry has established education consulting quality safety big data and internet regulatory technology platforms, enabling effective real-time monitoring of education consulting quality and important safety indicators.\n    Prosperous supply forms. Continue to support the integration and development of education consulting industry with internet and other industries, enriching new models and business forms in the education consulting industry.\n    This is currently attracting more social capital attention, with development opportunities brought by the integration of education consulting industry with other related industries. Current Internet+, real-time broadcast+, mobile+, e-commerce+, 5G+, etc., are examples of integration between the education consulting industry and related industries, marking important starting points for the education consulting industry to truly promote consumption transformation and upgrading. The integration and development of these major industries will generate countless new models and formats in the education consulting industry.\n    From this, we can see that China has begun to truly implement and promote the development of the education consulting industry. Previously, the education consulting profit model was singular, and the industry felt very confused, unable to find development direction. Although working hard, failure to receive deserved compensation made many lose confidence in persisting. Supporting the comprehensive development of education consulting industry and related industries, and formulating specific effective support policies will play a huge role in promoting the development of education consulting industry and enable it to find new profit points and establish new development profit models.\n\n(6) Broad Market for Education Consulting Talent Training with Promising International Cooperation\n    Strengthen talent support, advance education consulting professional education system construction, establish character, capability, and performance-oriented professional title evaluation and skill level assessment systems, expand career development space for education consulting professionals, enhance their professional honor and social recognition, promote guarantees, and gradually increase salaries for education consulting practitioners across regions. The continuous expansion of education consulting teams of professionals, technicians, and service personnel will be a major trend in future industry development.\n    Talent, especially professionals, is fundamental to education consulting industry development. Currently, talent has become a key factor constraining industry development. Solving the professional talent issue requires improving higher education consulting, establishing professional talent education systems, establishing education consulting majors meeting market demands, correctly positioning professional talents, and establishing vocational colleges for training professional service talent. Without a complete talent cultivation teaching and practice system, it's necessary to actively introduce mature foreign education consulting professional talent education systems, conduct in-depth research, combine with national conditions, and establish suitable international education consulting industry talent training courses and practice systems. Currently, China's education consulting technology alliance is negotiating with countries including the US, Japan, Australia, Canada, and Italy for professional education consulting talent training system cooperation, with preliminary plans to introduce foreign education consulting technology talent training as an important path to rapidly establish China's education consulting talent training system.\n\n(7) Education Consulting Industry Development Needs to Break Through Innovation Bottlenecks\n    The development trend of education consulting is that intelligence and ecology will become new standards and highlights. This trend can be seen from three levels. First is customer requirements. Practitioners have increasingly high requirements for education consulting and service quality. Second is government management objectives, initially only targeting enterprises. While doing good foundational work was enough before, now it's not sufficient. Besides high-quality infrastructure operators, clear directional guidance is needed in industry standards, prospects, trends, etc., with continuously increasing management requirements. Third is investor expectations. It's now difficult to increase product value with low-end technology, so many companies are changing direction to improve quality and value through industrial upgrading. Therefore, education consulting needs to continuously improve its innovation capabilities, break through industry bottlenecks, and achieve high-quality development.", "checklist": [{"name": "Comprehensiveness of Content Coverage", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how thoroughly the response addresses all five requested sections of the guidance document, including preparation work, communication steps, process explanation, parental support strategies, and case references.", "1-2": "Severely incomplete coverage with multiple major sections entirely missing;

However, there are significant differences in educational equity between regions, which have profound impacts on the distribution of educational resources and student development. This article will explore issues related to regional differences in educational equity and analyze possible causes and solutions.\n\nI. Impact of Regional Differences on Educational Equity\nRegional differences affect educational equity in multiple ways. First, uneven distribution of educational resources leads to differentiated educational conditions between regions. There are significant gaps in educational resource allocation between developed and underdeveloped regions, resulting in students in poor areas facing lower quality education and resource scarcity. Second, different regions' economic levels and socio-cultural backgrounds also affect students' learning opportunities and academic achievement. Students in wealthy areas often have access to more tutoring resources and quality school environments, while students in poor areas face more learning difficulties and unequal opportunities.\n\nII. Analysis of Causes of Regional Differences\n1. Economic Development Disparities: Different levels of economic development between regions is one of the main causes of regional differences in educational equity. Economically developed regions can provide more educational resources and better learning environments, while economically backward regions cannot provide adequate support.\n\n2. Policy and Investment Imbalances: Uneven government investment in education is also an important cause of regional differences. Some regions experience unequal distribution of educational resources due to insufficient policy support, shortage of educational funds, and lack of related supporting measures.\n\n3. Cultural and Social Background: Differences in cultural and social backgrounds between regions are also important causes of educational regional differences. Students in some regions have easier access to good learning resources and opportunities due to factors such as cultural identity and family environment.\n\nIII. Solutions to Educational Regional Differences\nTo address educational regional differences, active participation and joint efforts are needed from government, educational institutions, schools, and all sectors of society. Here are some possible solutions:\n\n1. Increase Investment in Education in Poor Areas: Governments should increase investment in education in poor areas, provide more financial support, improve school infrastructure, and provide better educational resources.\n\n2.

Introduction\nSchool-family cooperation is an important model in education, aimed at promoting effective connection between school education and family education, forming educational synergy to jointly promote students' comprehensive development. This article will analyze specific cases and summarize experiences and lessons to provide reference for future school-family cooperation.\n\nII. Case Sharing\nCase 1: In implementing quality education, an elementary school actively promoted school-family cooperation by regularly organizing parent meetings and parent-child activities to enhance interaction between parents and children. Through these activities, parents gained a deeper understanding of the school's educational philosophy and teaching methods, while better participating in their children's growth process.\n\nCase 2: In addressing psychological issues of adolescent students, a middle school communicated with parents through school-family cooperation to jointly focus on students' mental health. The school invited psychological counselors to conduct lectures for parents, providing family education guidance to help parents better handle children's psychological issues.\n\nCase 3: A high school's school-family cooperation model focused on cultivating students' independent learning abilities. The school established a parent-teacher communication platform, regularly publishing students' learning situations and behavioral performance, enabling parents to stay informed about their children's learning status and discuss educational methods with teachers.\n\nIII. Reflections and Summary\n1. Issues Requiring Attention in School-Family Cooperation\nAlthough the above cases demonstrate positive effects of school-family cooperation, some issues still need attention in practical operation. First, how to ensure the continuity of school-family cooperation, avoiding communication only during special periods (like school opening or mid-term exams)? Second, how to balance the roles of schools and parents, avoiding single-party dominance? Finally, how to improve parents' participation enthusiasm, making them truly important partners in school education?\n\n2. Improvement Suggestions\n(1) Establish Long-term Mechanism: Schools should develop long-term cooperation plans, clearly defining cooperation goals and activity arrangements for each stage. Meanwhile, ensure plan implementation and regularly evaluate cooperation effectiveness.\n\n(2) Clarify Role Positioning: Schools and parents should establish equal, mutual trust relationships. Schools should respect parents' opinions and suggestions, actively adopting reasonable proposals. Parents should also respect and support school work, actively participating in school-organized activities.\n\n(3) Increase Parent Participation: Schools can improve parents' educational awareness and abilities through family education lectures and expert teaching. Additionally, schools can establish parent volunteer systems, encouraging parents to participate in school management and teaching, enhancing their sense of participation and belonging.\n\n(4) Strengthen Communication and Feedback: Schools should regularly communicate with parents, understanding their opinions and suggestions about school work. Meanwhile, timely feedback about children's performance and growth at school should be provided to parents. Through two-way communication, educational synergy can be formed to promote students' comprehensive development.\n\nIV. Conclusion\nSchool-family cooperation is an important component of modern education, significant for improving educational quality and promoting students' comprehensive development. In future work, we need to further summarize experiences and lessons, continuously improving the school-family cooperation model to better serve students' growth. In summary, school-family cooperation requires joint efforts from both parties to form educational synergy for better educational outcomes.", "checklist": [{"name": "Speech Structure Adherence", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the speech follows the requested framework with introduction (welcome, school background), core content (educational philosophy, examples, collaboration), and conclusion (encouraging participation).

Some leading toy companies have begun positioning themselves in intelligence and personalization, leading market development through innovative products and technologies.\n\n3. Environmental Protection and Sustainability as Important Issues\n\nEnvironmental protection and sustainability will become important issues in future toy industry development. Consumer demand for eco-friendly toys will push manufacturers to use more renewable and biodegradable materials, reducing environmental impact. Meanwhile, toy companies need to focus on product sustainability and recyclability, promoting industry-wide environmental and sustainable development through designing recyclable and biodegradable toys.\n\nGovernments and enterprises will strengthen cooperation, formulating and implementing relevant policies to promote green development in the toy industry. For example, some governments have begun introducing policies encouraging toy companies to use eco-friendly materials and technologies, reducing waste emissions. Meanwhile, some companies have voluntarily adopted environmentally friendly production methods, pushing the entire industry toward more environmental and sustainable development.\n\n4. Cross-industry Cooperation and Innovation Becoming Normal\n\nCross-industry cooperation and innovation will become normal in future toy industry development. Toy companies will cooperate with more industries to jointly develop innovative and competitive new products. For example, integration of toys with animation, games, and education will create more new products and services meeting consumers' diverse needs.\n\nMeanwhile, toy companies need to strengthen cooperation and exchange with other industries to jointly promote industry innovation. For example, cooperating with e-commerce platforms to expand online sales channels and collaborating with cultural creative enterprises to develop toys with cultural content. Such cross-industry cooperation will promote diversified development in the toy industry, providing consumers with more diverse choices.\n\nThe toy industry, as a vibrant and innovative field, has experienced significant growth and transformation in recent years. With changes in family structure, consumption concepts, and technological advancement, the toy market shows trends toward diversification and intelligence.

2023 年底全球 39% 的知识型员工将从事混合工作，高于 2022 年的 37%。预计远程工作者的数量将继续逐年下降，到 2023 年底，远程工作者将占全球所有员工的 9%。\n美国的混合工作趋势将比世界其他地区更为明显，预计到2023年，51% 的知识工作者将进行混合工作，20% 将完全远程工作。\n虚拟工作空间，为面对面会议（以及相关公派外出）和现有的虚拟会议解决方案提供了具有潜在颠覆性的新替代方案。Gartner预测显示，到2025年将有10%的员工使用虚拟空间进行销售、入职和远程工作等活动。\n自2019年以来，绝大部分的国家采用混合线上+线下，或者是完全远程工作的员工，比例相对都有所提高。与全球其他雇主相比，日本雇主更关注全职返回办公室的员工数量。在日本，到2023年完全远程和混合知识工作者的数量将占其劳动力的 29%。\n在欧洲，面对面工作仍然是首选，混合工作方式预计将在2023年增长。例如德国，2023 年完全远程和混合知识工作者将占其劳动力的49%。鉴于文化和垂直行业组合，英国完全远程和混合知识工作者的数量将在同期上升，2023 年完全远程和混合型知识型员工将占其劳动力的67%。\nNAI Global 远程和混合工作趋势调查结果\n纽约, 2023年6月26日  NAI Global 发布了一份关于远程和混合工作趋势的调查结果，涵盖了其在欧洲、非洲和亚太地区的国际办事处。\n\n疫情大流行带来的远程办公现象（WFH）或远程和混合工作已成为最独特的方面之一，也产生了相应的后果。在现代劳动力的历史上，我们没有被迫从办公室以外的任何地方经营办公室导向的业务和任务，旅行推销员、并购专业人士、审计师等明显是例外。到了2020年夏末和封锁的早期阶段，有关这一新工作趋势的报道开始出现在各种媒体上，并且一直没有停歇。\n\n在《华尔街日报》（WSJ）最近发表的一篇主要关注欧洲和亚洲的远程和混合工作趋势以及其对全球办公市场的影响的报道之后，NAI Global与其在欧洲、中东、非洲和亚太地区的1,000多名经纪、管理和物业咨询专家进行了联系。巧合的是，正当调查结果正在整理成叙述形式时，彭博智能发布了一份关于远程工作对欧洲办公市场影响的报告。\n\n根据《华尔街日报》的报道，越来越多的美国人采用了远程工作，并抛弃了办公室，美国最大城市的办公室入住率在40%至60%之间。这些数字通常归功于刷卡公司 Kastle Systems，是办公室入住率的良好参考标准，尽管自从该公司开始发布数据以来，我们一直建议这些指标可能没有完全展示全貌。它们是可信的，但稍有缺陷，因为大多数美国办公室工作者并不在 Kastle Systems 追踪的10个主要市场工作。因此，根据我们对美国 48 个州（约有 225 个 NAI Global 美国办事处）的 NAI Global 办事处进行的内部调查，我们认为美国各个区域的城市中，有更多的人在办公室工作。\n\n在海外，华尔街日报报道称，欧洲和中东的办公室入住率达到70%至90%，而亚洲地区的入住率甚至更高，范围在80%至110%之间。这意味着在某些情况和地方，近期前往办公室的人数比疫情前更多。\n\n这些不同数据读数存在许多原因和解释，而华尔街日报指出了其中一些原因，包括文化差异、通勤时间和居住安排等。这些原因与我们在对NAI Global在美国以外的专业人员进行调查时所发现的情况并无二致。以下是我们在电子邮件查询后收到的一些回复摘要，包括回复者及其所在城市和国家的归属。\n\n欧洲\n\n在法兰克福这个欧洲最重要的金融中心之一，正在进行着一场“人才争夺战”，因此雇主们意识到他们必须互相竞争以争取这些人才。因此，越来越多的公司开始思考，“我该如何设计我的办公室，以鼓励和吸引员工返回办公室？”这是一个如此重要的问题，以至于“在家办公”已经成为各个年龄段员工的重要因素。因此，员工每周在家办公的平均天数为1.4天，这在德国普遍存在。根据官方统计数据，德国的数据低于全球平均水平。然而，现代办公室本身仍然是企业身份的重要因素，代表着“我们”的意义，尤其是员工之间的沟通。在疫情之前，一切都在通过新的工作环境显著改善公司内部的沟通；而通过“在家办公”，这种至关重要的沟通被最大程度地减少了。\n安德烈亚斯·克罗内（Andreas Krone），NAI apollo 首席执行官，NAI 董事，德国法兰克福\n\n“在匈牙利，混合工作安排继续实施，大多数办公室员工每周有保证的最低两天在家办公。然而，在业务流程外包（BPO）和共享服务中心（SSC）的情况下，员工每周有机会在家办公三天并不少见。远程工作的选择已成为员工薪酬套餐的重要组成部分，对这一趋势不太支持的雇主可能面临更高的员工流失率，并且难以吸引新人才。因此，办公租户平均放弃了先前办公空间的20%。”\n埃里卡·洛斯卡（Erika Lóska），NAI CELand 租赁服务主管，合作伙伴，匈牙利布达佩斯\n\nNAI Global 总结：欧洲的商业领导者似乎面临着与美国同行类似的挑战——尽管欧洲的失业率平均较美国高，但主要存在着争夺最佳员工的竞争。在合作的重要性方面，欧洲的商业文化再次倾向于员工之间高度的互联互通。然而，当涉及业务任务工作时，无论是数据输入、会计和行政流程工作，这些工作可以很容易地在远程完成，远程工作的比例更高。这在美国也是如此，编程人员或技术人员花费大部分时间在显示器前，他们对远程工作安排有着强烈的偏好，表达得最为明显。\n\n非洲\n\n“在安哥拉首都罗安达，尽管通勤困难，专业人士以很高的比例返回工作场所。城市以外的断断续续的互联网连接有效地鼓励基于办公室的专业人士返回办公室，因为那里的网络连接往往更强大、更稳定。”\n努诺·塞伦尼奥（Nuno Serrenho），NAI Altys Africa 主管，安哥拉罗安达\n\nNAI Global 总结：塞伦尼奥先生的引述说明了一个问题，即基础设施在世界某些地方是一个问题，而基于办公室的工作确实需要高质量的互联网接入。（同样，没有人会在美国某些内陆州设立总部设施，因为在许多平原州和地点，手机信号可能不稳定）。通勤是美国最大城市以及世界各地其他大型城市办公室入住率较低的最大障碍，然而，这些大城市及其周围100英里范围内大多都有良好的互联网接入。\n\n亚太地区\n\n“中国在2022年1月开始实施严格的封锁措施，因此当人们重新回到工作岗位时，他们对此感到高兴。尽管存在明显的权衡取舍，比如在交通高峰期通勤，但大多数人在大城市中居住在较小的公寓中，因此去办公室可以给他们带来一些宽慰。此外，文化上，外出活动是人们在这里喜欢做的事情——盛装打扮、佩戴精美的珠宝、购物和商务午餐。在办公室工作也让人们有一种正常的自豪感，感觉自己在办公室取得了成就。对于大多数办公室员工来说，幸运的是，他们喜欢在那里工作，因为目前大多数中国公司每周只提供一天的远程办公。然而，除了要求返回办公室外，管理者们强烈认为面对面的交流能够提高效率——以非正式和随意的方式分享想法和经验，以及发展和培养公司文化。”\n比亚尔内·鲍尔（Bjarne Bauer），SIOR，NAI Sofia Group 商业房地产交易总经理合伙人，中国上海\n\n新西兰和澳大利亚\n\n在NAI Global最重要的亚太市场中，关于远程和混合工作的观点在新西兰和澳大利亚分歧较大，这在很大程度上是由于城市（或市场）规模和通勤时间的影响，或者说缺乏通勤时间的影响。\n\n根据安德鲁·布鲁斯（Andrew Bruce）的说法，办公场所已经永久改变。混合工作模式已经成为常态，企业需要在让员工返回办公室的愿望与员工继续在家工作的需求之间做出权衡。妥协已经成为新的常态，例如每周1-2天的远程工作选项现在很常见。布鲁斯继续说，办公空间正在重新定义，员工并不怀念进入办公室的感觉，他们所怀念的是社交接触和个人协作等。现在更加强调改善办公室设计，企业寻求更大的厨房区域、休息室、协作休息区等，所有这些都旨在给员工一个愿意来办公室的理由。\n安德鲁·布鲁斯，NAI Harcourts 北岸/奥克兰分行经理/业务所有人，新西兰\n\n“新西兰对Covid 19的威胁作出了非常迅速的反应，我们的政府在2020年3月25日和2021年8月21日两次强制将全国封锁。我们都开始在家工作，很多人预测远程工作的变化。旺格雷有大约10万居民，所以我们没有真正的交通问题，大多数人能在15到20分钟内往返于工作和家中。这里的公司很快意识到分离和缺乏协作思维对他们业务的生产力产生了负面影响。我们经历的结果是对良好办公空间的需求增加，超过了供应。我们仍然有足够的二流空间，但对此的需求不高；这完全是由于办公空间本身质量差。虽然在家工作是一种理念上的概念，但在我们这里实际上并不奏效。”\n彼得·皮特斯（Peter Peeters），商业与工业专员，NAI Harcourts，新西兰北岛旺格雷地区\n\n“在疫情后，我们注意到商业领域对办公空间的需求出现了相当大的下降。我认为，疫情让大企业和小型企业都意识到他们可以在员工在家工作的同时成功经营业务，并在装修、支出以及租金方面节省大量资金。我们看到办公空间，尤其是在一楼的空间，只能作为办公空间使用，没有其他期望的用途 - 它们会在市场上停留很长时间，长达12个月，在此之前市场需求非常高。”\n杰克·蒙德（Jack Maunder），商业销售、租赁和管理，NAI Harcourts，新南威尔士州大港麦夸里地区\n\n“在澳大利亚的首要市场中，回到办公室工作的速度似乎比许多国际同行要快得多。大多数市场报告显示恢复至疫情前水平的70-80%。尽管有这个统计数据，但仍然可以看到混合办公/在家工作（WFH）“有些日子”的模式仍在发挥作用。这一趋势在一些主要街道的办公室中留下了一种相当萧条的感觉，员工对在家工作模式的喜爱引发了更大的反对意见。悉尼和墨尔本作为澳大利亚最大的两个城市似乎最难应对这个问题，许多中央商务区的零售商报告人流量减少和零售销售额下降。复苏正在进行中，但前方仍然有一些颠簸。”\nJason Luckhardt, 国家经理，NAI Harcourts，昆士兰州布里斯班，澳大利亚\n\n最终结论：与其他市场类似，希望办公室工作的人数增加的偏见存在。办公室人员使得建筑周围地区更加活跃和有活力。此外，NAI Global的回答者都在房地产行业工作，因此他们本质上是希望办公室需求增加的。城市密度、生活水平、城市规模和通勤时间显然是影响亚太地区远程办公偏好的重要因素，就像它们在美国和欧洲一样。另一个共同点是房地产业主和业主已经意识到需要投资于办公楼，并要求租户和使用者通过改造内部空间，使办公空间更加舒适、具有合作性，并最终更具吸引力。这些都是NAI Global专业人员的普遍观点，不论城市、大陆和文化背景如何。", "checklist": [{"name": "Content_Comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates whether the response covers all required sections with appropriate depth,

Length should be no less than 5,000 words, ensuring comprehensive and sufficient content; 2. Follow a fixed format including seven sections: introduction, current situation analysis, blockchain technology overview, detailed application scenarios (specific cases or solutions in judicial evidence authentication), risk and challenge analysis, policy and practical recommendations, and conclusion; 3. The writing style should be academically rigorous and formal, suitable for official use within the court system; 4. Incorporate user identity characteristics, such as reflecting the concerns of high-level court decision-makers; 5. Content should combine domestic and international judicial practice cases, specifically explaining the innovation and efficiency of blockchain technology in judicial evidence storage, transmission, and verification processes, and clarify the foreseeable policy effects or potential issues of these practices. Ensure the content can assist courts in exploring blockchain technology pilot work and provide operational suggestions for standards and legislation.\nDomestic and international successful cases of blockchain technology applications in judicial scenarios refer to Successful Applications of Blockchain Technology in Judicial Scenarios Domestically and Internationally:\n7 Practical Cases and Applications of Blockchain in the Legal Field\n\nOver the past year, blockchain technology has received considerable attention for its transformative capabilities across various industries. At its core, blockchain provides technology for creating and maintaining immutable and transparent distributed shared ledgers that can be used to store information.\n\nWhen discussing high-tech industries, the legal sector rarely comes to mind. After all, lawyers are often buried in mountains of paperwork, and the classic legal profession film \"The Paper Chase\" ends with a campus yard covered in papers. However, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize legal affairs and make history—there is already a global legal blockchain consortium aimed at standardizing and promoting blockchain applications.\n\nHere are seven areas where blockchain will significantly impact the legal field:\n\n1. Smart Contracts\nLegal contracts still require personal signatures on original documents, taking considerable time to complete legally binding agreements.\nBlockchain promises to digitize this process through \"smart contracts.\" These smart contracts can be created and executed directly between relevant parties with minimal lawyer involvement. OpenLaw aims to use blockchain to reduce \"costs and friction in creating, securing, and generating legally binding agreements.\" It also plans to eliminate the need for intermediaries and provide tools for storing these agreements. This is truly disruptive technology as it potentially removes lawyers from the process.\n\n2. Intellectual Property\nIn the digital age, law has been struggling to protect intellectual property such as images, audio files, designs, and logos. Artists and musicians try to protect their work but often face unauthorized use, while low-profit streaming services fail to provide royalties. Companies like NKOR promise to launch platforms for registering intellectual property and \"locking\" it on the blockchain.\n\n3. Blockchain Law\nLaw adapts to changing social needs. Ten years ago, the legal industry needed to address digital media rights, and some lawyers quickly focused on studying this area of law. Now, law needs to adapt again to blockchain's potential applications across many industries, and lawyers need to begin specializing in blockchain law—the new frontier of digital law.\n\nAt a recent International Legal Technology Association (ILTACON) annual conference, discussions about artificial intelligence were reportedly replaced by blockchain, with an entire track dedicated to its legal applications.\n\n4. Property Rights\nProperty rights include the buying and selling of property and leases. At your local government property office, it's easy to find a place seemingly stuck in the last century—piles of ledgers, paper deeds, and title documents tracking property ownership. Even when offices transition to digital, they essentially just scan all documents for orderly storage in databases.\n\nThis is also a problem in developing countries, lacking infrastructure to protect individual property rights and experiencing frequent disputes. For instance, some land records in India date back to colonial-era written records, and these old, unclear records are a common source of ownership disputes in most countries.\n\nBlockchain, with its inherent security and digital ledger functionality, promises to store important property rights data, including land ownership and transfer details, in an efficient, secure, and immutable way.\n\nIndia held an international conference in 2017 titled \"Blockchain for Property Rights Management: Conference on Secure Distributed Ledger for Property Title\" to address digital property rights issues.\n\n5. Chain of Custody\nChain of custody is a crucial legal concept that records evidence in criminal cases. Typically, written records are created for each piece of evidence and must be preserved completely until the evidence is presented in court. The challenge is that if the chain of custody is not fully maintained, defense attorneys will motion to dismiss the evidence, regardless of its importance, severely weakening the prosecution's position.\n\nChain of custody is challenging with physical evidence and even more so with digital evidence, such as files found on hard drives or devices connected to wireless network logs.\nBlockchain is an ideal tool for chain of custody, especially for more challenging digital files. Here, blockchain technology can be used not only to track files but also to store them. Through digital ledgers, evidence is digitally preserved, creating permanent records in the chain of custody, preventing evidence loss while eliminating the need for chain of custody testimony, saving additional time.\n\n6. Financial Transactions\nAs more financial transactions use Bitcoin and other blockchain-supported digital currencies, lawyers will need deeper understanding of them. The anonymity and low visibility of these digital currencies have already attracted criminals.\n\nAs these crypto assets become mainstream and our speculation about their use in real currency transactions grows, lawyers need to become familiar with their appearance in various scenarios, from divorce proceedings to wills and international transactions.\n\n7. Notaries\nCurrently, notaries (or general notaries) are used to confirm and verify signatures on legal documents such as deeds and contracts. Using blockchain technology, these documents can be digitally preserved as part of a digital ledger.\n\nA company called Blocknotary has already begun applying blockchain technology to legal documents, providing \"timestamps and fingerprints for media files,\" thus eliminating the current need for notary stamps.", "checklist": [{"name": "Content Comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates whether the response meets the 5,000-word requirement and thoroughly addresses all seven required sections with sufficient depth and detail in each component.", "1-2": "Severely underdeveloped content (under 2,000 words) with multiple missing sections and extremely superficial treatment of the topic, failing to meet the basic length requirement.", "3-4": "Significantly shorter than required (2,000-3,500 words) with incomplete coverage of required sections and insufficient development of key concepts in blockchain judicial applications.", "5-6": "Approaches but may not fully reach 5,000 words, covers all sections but with uneven depth;

近3年全国行政复议工作数据统计报告：\n2022年，全国行政复议案件立案总量达26.9万多件，约70%的案件实现“案结事了”——行政复议，让争议化解更加便民高效\n近年来，越来越多的行政争议通过行政复议得到化解。据统计，2022年全国行政复议案件立案总量达26.9万多件，约70%的案件实现“案结事了”；审结案件中作出纠错决定2.9万件，制发行政复议意见书2683份。在服务经济社会发展方面，严格依法办理与市场主体关系密切的行政复议案件1.9万件，依法纠正土地管理领域违法行政行为3217起，涉及土地33.1万亩。行政复议化解行政争议的主渠道作用逐步彰显，在维护群众合法权益、促进社会和谐稳定、加快法治政府建设方面发挥了重要作用。\n这是行政复议体制改革结出的硕果——2020年4月，中央全面依法治国委员会印发《行政复议体制改革方案》，行政复议体制改革工作在全国全面部署推进。2022年10月，《中华人民共和国行政复议法（修订草案）》提请十三届全国人大常委会审议，以立法方式巩固改革成果，更好推进复议为民，提高行政复议公信力。\n灵活高效化解行政争议\n日常生活中，人们免不了会跟行政执法打交道。如，维持交通安全秩序的交通执法，对路边乱摆乱放行为的城管执法，对餐饮店食品质量安全的工商执法。但是对不少人而言，“行政复议”还是一个陌生的词汇。在我国，行政复议是解决行政系统内“民告官”行政争议的一种制度。当公民与行政机关发生行政争议时，除了到法院起诉，与行政机关“对簿公堂”，通过行政复议推动行政机关自我纠错，也是一种常见的选择。\n“行政复议制度的初衷，是通过行政系统内自我监督更加灵活高效地化解行政争议。”中国政法大学法治政府研究院教授曹鎏指出，相较于行政诉讼，行政复议是免费的，成本更低；行政复议可以直接变更行政行为，更为高效；行政复议从合法性和合理性两方面对行政行为进行审查，与行政诉讼相比，对行政行为的审查范围更加广泛，审查强度更深。\n长期以来，在化解行政争议方面一直存在“大信访、中诉讼、小复议”的格局。“以往，由于人们对行政复议并不熟悉，加之传统的行政复议‘关门审理、内部监督’往往被认为是官官相护，导致很多本可以通过行政复议快速解决的案件，还是源源不断地流向法院。”中国人民大学法学院教授莫于川指出，这导致行政复议制度没有发挥出应有的作用，同时有限的司法资源更加紧张。\n行政复议体制改革势在必行。在前期改革试点的基础上，2020年4月，中央全面依法治国委员会印发《行政复议体制改革方案》，行政复议体制改革工作在全国全面部署推进。\n“区县以上人民政府统一行使复议职权、建立行政复议咨询委员会为重大疑难复杂案件提供咨询意见、健全完善运用行政复议倒逼依法行政推进法治政府建设的监督机制、加强行政复议规范化信息化建设……针对实践中存在的诸多问题，改革均有相应回应。”曹鎏表示。\n“通过改革，行政复议制度的活力被激发了，其效能正充分释放。”莫于川指出。据北京市朝阳区司法局行政复议一科科长张秀梅介绍，2022年，朝阳区政府新收行政复议案件2003件，是上年的2.8倍；共审结复议案件1726件，纠错率为10.66%，调解率为37.6%，综合化解率达48.26%。今年一季度，区政府共计新收行政复议案件860件，是往年同期案件量的5倍左右。\n加强行政复议“主渠道”作用\n行政复议体制改革启动以来，不少地方便开启了行政复议工作机制改革创新，探索出不少好的做法，努力让行政复议成为化解行政争议的主渠道。比如，广西、甘肃等地探索建立行政复议员制度，促进行政复议队伍职业化、专业化建设；浙江杭州提出了“行政复议监审员”的概念，主动接受社会监督，推动阳光办案。\n根据《行政复议体制改革方案》，2022年6月30日，北京市朝阳区政府行政复议受理中心挂牌成立，行政复议实现“一口对外”；同年7月1日，北京市行政复议职权集中至市、区两级政府统一行使。作为北京市首家专业化区政府行政复议受理中心，朝阳区复议受理中心一经成立，便迎来业务的猛增期。每天前来咨询复议的群众络绎不绝，较改革前大为增加。\n张秀梅对记者说，改革后，朝阳区实现了行政复议受理“一张网”全覆盖，依托一个受理中心、一个受理分中心和各街道办事处、乡政府司法所的43个行政复议宣传咨询点，实现行政争议案件渠道畅通、繁简分流，实现“简案快审、繁案精审”，行政复议化解行政争议主渠道作用大大加强。\n人民群众的认可最能反映改革的成效。有市民感叹，以前复议不知道该去哪里、该找谁；如今有了专门的复议场所，有了专业的复议接待人员，而且不收费，特别便民利民。\n以往，从事行政复议的工作人员很多都身兼数职。随着改革后行政复议案件数量日益增加，急需建立一支正规化、专业化、职业化的行政复议队伍。2022年，甘肃省在推动实现省、市（州）、县（市、区）各级只保留一个行政复议机关的同时，首创行政复议员由省政府统一管理制度，出台《甘肃省行政复议员管理办法（试行）》，对行政复议员的概念、行政复议员资格条件、任命方式、资格撤销、禁业范围、表彰奖励等作出规定。\n“各地的创新做法与生动实践，为推动行政复议改革提档升级、推动法律修改完善提供了样本参考。”曹鎏说。\n如今，群众一封信、一个电子邮件就可以提出行政复议申请，足不出户也能化解烦心事，越发便捷的复议渠道，给了群众实实在在的获得感。\n更好推动行政争议实质性解决\n2022年10月，行政复议法修订草案首次提请全国人大常委会审议。作为全面总结改革实践经验的重要举措，此次修法备受瞩目。\n“此次修法涉及多方面，比如取消地方人民政府工作部门的行政复议职责、行政复议受案范围进一步扩大、进一步完善行政复议受理、审理程序及决定形式等，这是对近年来我国行政复议体制改革实践成果的一次提炼与总结。”谈到行政复议法大修，莫于川表示，近年来学界与实务界对行政复议制度给予了较大关注，与此相关的学术研讨一直在进行，相关的学术论文与著作更是呈“井喷式”增长。\n此次修法扩大了行政复议受案范围，比如明确对行政协议、政府信息公开等行为不服的可以申请行政复议；扩大行政复议前置范围，明确对依法当场作出的行政处罚决定、行政不作为不服的，应当先申请行政复议。\n“要进一步发挥行政复议化解行政争议主渠道作用，就要让行政复议这一制度尽可能地吸纳行政争议，确保行政争议进入行政复议程序的‘量’；同时不断提升行政复议解决行政争议的‘质’，尽可能将吸纳的行政争议通过行政复议程序有效化解。”曹鎏说，行政复议具有统筹调度资源配置的天然优势，能够通过穿透式监督实现对依法行政的倒逼与提升，扩大行政复议受案范围和增加复议前置内容，有利于实质性化解行政争议。\n完善制度机制、提升行政争议实质性化解质效，是这次修法的重要特征。“根据我国行政诉讼法规定，经复议的案件，复议机关决定维持原行政行为的，作出原行政行为的行政机关和复议机关是共同被告；复议机关改变原行政行为的，复议机关是被告。”曹鎏表示，共同被告制度在倒逼复议机关提高纠错率方面发挥了作用。但同时，这一设计也可能引发新风险，即复议机关因不愿承担当被告的风险而陷入“驳回会”的困境，甚至引发程序空转。她认为，此次修法有必要综合评估考虑双被告制度，为进一步提升行政复议实质性化解行政争议质效优化制度支撑。\n2023年全国共依法办结行政复议案件29.3万件\n司法部2023年法治政府建设年度报告近日对外发布。报告显示，2023年，全国各级行政复议机构新收行政复议案件31.5万件，同比增长17.1%；依法办结行政复议案件29.3万件，同比增长14.45%，其中司法部办结国务院行政复议案件4644件。\n\n司法部推动持续提升行政复议质效，指导各级行政复议机构依法办理涉及民生领域行政复议案件6.38万件，涉企行政复议案件3万余件。2023年，全国各级行政复议机构通过调解、和解方式结案3.7万件，一大批行政争议得到实质性化解。\n\n为加大依法行政监督力度，各级行政复议机构全年作出撤销、变更、确认违法和责令履行决定等纠错决定2.73万件，纠错率达12.83%。全国共制发行政复议意见书、建议书3800余份，实现“办理一案、规范一片”，从源头上有效促进依法行政。\n\n在行政立法方面，司法部制定加强重点领域、新兴领域立法工作意见及规划，拟订并执行国务院2023年度立法工作计划，审查完成立法项目51件。坚持立改废释并举，对604部行政法规开展全面集中清理，组织开展涉及黄河流域保护、青藏高原生态保护、行政复议等相关法规规章行政规范性文件专项清理，有力维护国家法治统一。\n\n司法部坚持“有件必备、有备必审、有错必纠”，依法审查各地方、各部门报送备案的法规规章3021件，按照法定程序和权限纠正和处理存在违反上位法问题的法规规章。指导各地加强行政规范性文件合法性审核工作，加大力度治理“红头文件”乱象，从源头上有效防止不当文件制定出台。\n2024年前9个月全国新收行政复议案件48.8万件\n　　新的一年迎面而来，亦正值新修订的行政复议法实施一周年之际。\n\n　　栉风沐雨，春华秋实。回顾2024年，全国各级行政复议机构全面贯彻党的二十届三中全会精神，以新修订行政复议法贯彻实施为契机，围绕行政复议全面提质增效采取了一系列举措，着力提升监督和治理效能，行政复议主渠道建设取得积极成效。\n\n　　收案数无疑是最直观可察的佐证。《法治日报》记者近日从司法部获悉，2024年1月至9月，全国新收行政复议案件48.8万件，达到同期行政诉讼一审案件数量的2.2倍。且经行政复议后，有35.1万件案件未再进入行政诉讼程序，行政复议案结事了率达90.1%。\n\n　　利国为民\n\n　　12月31日，2024年的最后一天，司法部发布了第五批贯彻实施新修订行政复议法典型案例。至此，司法部2024年发布的贯彻实施新修订行政复议法典型案例的数量已经达到27个。一年之中，多达五批典型案例发布，这样的高密度与快节奏足以体现司法部对此法贯彻实施的高度重视。\n\n　　行政复议是行政系统内部的层级监督制度和解决行政争议的救济制度，是党和国家监督体系的重要组成部分。\n\n　　于国家治理的大处看，新修订行政复议法的贯彻实施意义重大。“行政复议法的修订和实施是法治领域改革的重大成果。”中国法学会党组成员、学术委员会主任张文显说，行政复议法不只是行政领域的一项制度设计，而且是国家治理和社会治理体系中的重要制度设计。“我们要宣传好贯彻好实施好新修订的行政复议法，为推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化提供坚强法治保障。”\n\n　　于普通人琐碎生活的小处看，新修订行政复议法的贯彻实施不亚于抚慰人心的“冬日暖阳”。上海一位曾遭遇交通事故伤害的外卖骑手就从中获得权益的保障，成为新修订行政复议法实施的受益者之一。\n\n　　尽管交通事故已被交警部门认定为非本人主要责任，但上海市某区人力资源和社会保障局委托商业保险机构进行调查后，以发生交通事故时骑手处于下线状态为由，作出不予确认职业伤害结论书。骑手不服，理由在于，其行为符合《新就业形态就业人员职业伤害保障办法（试行）》关于在执行平台订单任务返回日常居所的合理路线途中受到非本人主要责任的交通事故，应当确认为职业伤害的规定，遂提起行政复议。\n\n　　行政复议机构通过听取意见、听证、现场勘查等查明事故发生时骑手处于执行任务后返回日常居所的案件事实。经行政复议机构指出问题，作为被申请人的人社局重新启动调查程序，并自行纠错，骑手自愿撤回行政复议申请。\n\n　　“就事论事”，从来不是行政复议的作风，这一个案件所带来的温暖已经扩及无数像这位骑手一样的新业态从业人员。为增强指导针对性，办理该起案件的行政复议机构还向人社部门和商业保险机构制发建议函，建议其严格规范职业伤害调查流程，把握新业态从业人员工作时间和工作地点非固定性的特点，全面调查核实事故情况，综合认定当事人工作状态，商业保险机构也对此进行了相应完善。\n\n　　实质解纷\n\n　　“复议为民”写进了新时代行政复议的基因里。在过去的一年，各级行政复议机关切实维护人民群众合法权益，积极畅通行政复议渠道，注重运用调解和解等方式解决人民群众的利益诉求。\n\n　　2024年1月至9月，以调解、和解等方式办结行政复议案件10.2万件，调撤结案率达26.2%。有1.8万件行政争议通过行政机关的自我纠错实现实质性化解。“大批行政争议实现源头化解、前端化解、就地化解，行政复议便民为民的制度优势更为凸显。”司法部行政复议与应诉局负责人说。\n\n　　在践行人民至上的同时，全国各级行政复议机构深入推进严格规范公正文明执法，倒逼各级行政执法机关提升依法行政水平，促进法治政府建设。2024年1月至9月，通过撤销、变更、确认违法等方式纠正违法和不当行政行为3.9万件，纠错率为13.1%。针对行政执法存在的共性问题制发行政复议意见书、建议书4271份，附带审查规范性文件420件，其中纠正不合法的规范性文件17件。\n\n　　“新修订的行政复议法在规范设置上着力形成个案纠错与整体纠偏的前后联动，在‘治已病’的同时，‘抓前端、治未病’，以点带面推动提升行政执法的规范化水平，实现办理一案、治理一行、惠及一片的良好示范效果，助力法治政府建设。”湖南大学法学院副教授展鹏贺说。\n\n　　市场主体同样从新修订的行政复议法的实施中获得高质量发展的动力。“真的非常感谢，行政复议让企业起死回生，也让我们深切感受到法治的力量。”云南省某药企负责人感慨地说。\n\n　　原来，当地药监部门曾查封了该药企的一批药材，并认定该批药材为假药，给予该药企没收假药和违法所得、罚款50万元的行政处罚决定。该药企不服，申请行政复议。经行政复议机构与申请人、被申请人反复沟通、充分释法说理，药监部门决定自行撤销行政处罚决定，并对涉案药企重新开展调查处理。该药企自愿撤回行政复议申请。随后，行政复议机构协调执法部门共同深入涉案药企，帮助指导企业加强自身建设，避免相关风险。\n\n　　记者从司法部了解到，2024年全国各级行政复议机构着力加强涉企行政复议工作，截至9月收到涉企行政复议案件5.1万件，以调解、和解等方式实质性化解1.05万件，纠正侵犯企业合法权益的违法、不当行政行为0.3万件，依法平等保护各类经营主体合法权益，助力优化法治化营商环境。\n\n　　提质增效\n\n　　一周年大考交卷之际，新修订行政复议法的贯彻实施这份答卷所呈现出来的是丰收之时的“硕果累累”，而“力透纸背”的是司法部这一年为此所作出的不懈努力。\n\n　　这一年，司法部联合有关部门开展行政复议护航企业高质量发展专项行动。为此发布的专项行动方案，围绕提高涉企行政复议工作水平提出5个方面18项具体举措，进一步畅通涉企行政复议渠道，做实涉企行政争议实质性化解工作。加强对涉企行政执法行为的监督纠错，依法平等保护各类经营主体合法权益，助力优化法治化营商环境。\n\n　　这一年，司法部加快完善行政复议配套制度。积极推进行政复议法实施条例修订工作，召开三次行政复议法实施条例修订研讨会。印发《行政复议普通程序听取意见办法》《行政复议普通程序听证办法》《关于进一步加强行政复议调解工作推动行政争议实质性化解的指导意见》等配套规范性文件。推动在中国法学会行政法学研究会组建行政复议专业委员会，借助“外脑”智慧为完善行政复议配套制度提供理论支撑。\n\n　　这一年，司法部组织行政执法人员云宣讲活动。以学习贯彻新修订的行政复议法为主题，聚焦解决当前行政执法中存在的突出问题，邀请实务工作者和专家学者剖析执法问题，解析执法案例，讲授经验做法，指导各地提高行政执法人员依法行政能力和水平。活动期间，培训平台总访问人次达510.2万，观看学习人次462.7万，有效增强执法人员依法履职和程序法治意识。\n\n　　这一年，司法部通过发布典型案例，指导各地将行政复议法规定的新程序、新机制落到实处，不断提升办案质效。\n\n　　新的一年已经开启。司法部行政复议与应诉局负责人表示，2025年，司法部将在行政复议提质增效、强基固本上下功夫，扎实推进行政复议主渠道建设和高质量发展，以行政复议现代化服务和支撑中国式现代化。加快配套制度建设，修订行政复议法实施条例，使行政复议制度供给更加规范、完备。完善“在线复议”各项功能，方便群众线上申请和参加复议。进一步发挥行政复议监督职能，规范涉企执法行为，优化法治化营商环境。加强行政复议“以案促治”，针对重点行政管理领域的突出问题发布行政复议典型案例，充分发挥行政复议意见书、建议书作用，推动严格规范公正文明执法。落实新修订行政复议法关于“国家建立专业化、职业化行政复议人员队伍”的规定，积极支持有条件的地方探索行政复议员制度。",

Through the portrayal of cultural backgrounds and zeitgeist, writers can effectively showcase social changes, cultural conflicts, and human struggles. This article will analyze several classic literary works to explore their cultural backgrounds and zeitgeist.\n\nI. \"Dream of the Red Chamber\"\n\"Dream of the Red Chamber\" is one of China's Four Great Classical Novels and a masterpiece in Chinese literary history. Set in the Qing Dynasty, it depicts the rise and fall of the Jia family, the love story between Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu, and the moral decay of feudal families, revealing the cultural background and people's predicaments during feudal times. The work presents the social class crisis under Manchu rule and the chaos in traditional moral values, exposing the corruption and hypocrisy of feudal society.\n\nThe zeitgeist in \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" is reflected in its criticism of feudal society and concern for human nature. Through rich character portrayals and detailed descriptions, it shows the complexity of human nature and people's helplessness under feudal constraints. Through the love story of Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu, the author expresses the pursuit of innocence and pain, calling for inner rebellion and the pursuit of ideals.\n\nII. \"1984\"\n\"1984\" is a dystopian novel by George Orwell that describes a highly authoritarian society. Set in a fictional future world, people's thoughts and behaviors are universally monitored and controlled. This work reveals the negative impacts of political suppression and ideological control on individuals and society.\n\nThe historical background of \"1984\" is the Cold War period shortly after World War II, when ideological conflicts between East and West were intense. Through describing the experiences of protagonist Winston Smith, the novel expresses questioning of authoritarian rule and human nature. The terrorizing regime, thought police, and false propaganda methods in the work reveal the political atmosphere and people's psychology of fear at that time.\n\nIII. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is a famous novel by Harper Lee set against the backdrop of racial discrimination in the American South. Through describing the story of a lawyer defending Tom Robinson, a black man, it explores justice, morality, racial issues, and the complexity of human nature.\n\nThe cultural background is the American South in the 1930s, where racial discrimination was deeply rooted. Through detailed descriptions and character development, the author shows the unjust treatment faced by Tom Robinson and society's tacit acceptance of racial discrimination. Meanwhile, through the process of protagonist Atticus Finch defending Tom Robinson, the work reveals the pursuit of justice and humanity.\n\nThese three literary works reveal cultural backgrounds and zeitgeist from different perspectives. Whether it's ancient Chinese feudal society's decline, Cold War political terror, or racial discrimination in the American South, writers present social issues to readers through their unique perspectives. Through reading and studying these works, we can better understand the cultural backgrounds of different eras, social changes, and common human challenges. draft news commentary, supplement in-depth analysis and interpretation regarding the influence of literature and art on the zeitgeist, enhancing the philosophical depth of the article.

法文名字）\n《翁费勒的塞纳河口》\n此画是1865年的官方沙龙上展出，并受到了热烈的欢迎，当评论家评论此画时说：“用调子所组成的和谐色彩……颇能吸引观众们的大胆感觉”。这表现出官方对人们很喜欢这幅画是完全可以理解的。油画表现了丰富的中间调子和那种暗淡、沉着的色阶。向深处展开的空间，通过河岸线而处理得十分成功按照传统，河岸线标志着中景和远景。在这幅画上，出于莫奈自己的东西，就是表现在前景水的笔触和云的笔触上的颇能吸引观众的大胆感觉，这些笔触加强了画面的传统效果。\n《日出·印象》\n莫奈创作了扬名于世的印象·日出。这幅油画描绘的是透过薄雾观望阿佛尔港口日出的景象。直接戳点的绘画笔触描绘出晨雾中不清晰的背景，多种色彩赋予了水面无限的光辉，并非准确地描画使那些小船依稀可见。真实地描绘了法国海港城市日出时的光与色给予画家的视觉印象。由于它突破了传统画法的束缚，有位批评家就借用此画的标题，嘲讽以莫奈为代表的一批要求革新创造的青年画家为印象主义，这一画派以此得名。这幅画在1874年开幕的印象派画家第1次联合展览会上展出，这幅作品是莫奈画作中最具典型的一幅。\n《圣日尔曼·卢昂大教堂》\n这幅画对于他未来风格的发展具有更大的意义。此画是他从罗浮宫的一个阳台上画的，这幅画是要表现树叶上的反光。并排的笔触生动地表现了空气的振动，依靠这些笔触的结合而取得了绿黄色的光和绿黑色的影的生动效果。这里的用笔方法已经是印象主义的了，但色彩还不够透明，甚至蓝色的阴影也还是浑浊的；它们画得就像是黑色。教堂和房子在颤动的树叶相比之下显得过于密集了。画中没有整体的形象，但树叶的画法却透露出一点莫奈的色彩理想来。\n《穿绿衣的女士——卡美伊》\n这幅肖像引起了争论，但总的说来是成功的；有人甚至把它同马奈的肖像画相媲美。这幅肖像充分显示出了莫奈的个性：他对造型的淡漠态度，以及这个女人的动势和她的裙子上颤动的光都赋予整幅画特殊的说服力；由此而产生了一种动力感和生动性。这里的画面基本上是根据一幅照片安排的，这说明莫奈并不介意使构图服从了自然景物的偶然性。照片本来也该使莫奈想到空间的深远效果的，然而，莫奈对此也并未介意。但这幅油画缺乏色调效果：光线和阴影落在了人物所占据的同一个平面上，因此，光线不能渗透人体，不能成为形的实体。大片固有色起了过多的作用。所有这些合在一起，与其说是真实表现了所见的事物，不如说是一种公式，但这种公式正是一个空前大胆的纲领。这一纲领的公式化一旦消失，光线便将渗入中间调子，生命也将渗透每一个笔触，而整体的统一也就将要形成，那时，艺术就会变得花团锦簇，印象主义就要完全成熟了。\n《圣拉查尔火车站》\n每一个研究莫奈创作活动发展的人都会发现，如果说最初的命运促成了莫奈的发展趋势，那么后来就是他自己创造了他的命运。之所以莫奈成为印象主义风格奠基人、被他的朋友公认为班首，是因为莫奈不可动摇的坚强意志。众所周知，印象主义意味着感觉和观察方式的变革，它不仅改变了绘画，而且改变了雕塑、音乐、文学，就是到了今天，它也没有失去影响力，仍然改变着我们。绘于1877年的圣拉查尔火车站是一幅表现巴黎火车站的画，这是一个日常生活场面的实际印象。莫奈神往于光线穿过玻璃顶棚射向蒸气烟云的效果，神往于从混沌之中显现出来的机车和车厢的形状。莫奈相信光线和空气的神奇效果是最为重要的，他巧妙的平衡了画面的调子和色彩，这幅画出色的表现了力量、空间、对比和运动。\n《睡莲》\n莫奈晚年最重要的一件作品是连作《睡莲》。这是一部宏伟史诗，是他一生中最辉煌灿烂的第九交响乐。1880年之后，莫奈与印象派的其他画家们疏远了，他在吉维尼造了一座小花园，住在里面作画。他喜欢把水与空气和某种具有意境的情调结合起来，这样产生了《睡莲》组画。沿着水面，美丽的睡莲一片片向湖面远处扩展开来，画家利用了树的倒影，衬托出花朵的层次，是十分有创造性的构思。莫奈把整个身心都投在这个池塘和他的睡莲上面了，睡莲成了他晚年描绘的主题。此后27年里，他几乎再也没有离开过这个主题。\n《野罂粟》\n该画作于1873年，当时莫奈的生活相对稳定。画中的人物是画家的妻子卡米耶和他们六岁的儿子让。母子俩在田野里采集鲜花，尽情享受着阳光，完全陶醉在大自然中。《野罂粟》中的人物给人以轻柔的、富有节奏的动感，然而画中那一片片鲜红的斑块才是这幅作品的要旨，是画家对映入眼帘的光和色所做的如实描绘。尽管这些斑块的形状具有罂粟的特征，却不是具体的，它们有的重叠在一起，有的被随意摆放，有的为了表现是在后面而被缩小，然而晦暗、单调的背景更加突出了鲜亮明快的暖色调。\n人物影响\n从印象主义的产生、发展看，创始人并非莫奈，但真正完全实现印象主义理念和技法、并且一以贯之的当推莫奈。是他将毕生精力献给了对西方画界产生了重要影响的印象主义，是以他为首的一批艺术家的不懈努力，突破了此前学院派的保守思想，极大地冲击了19世纪后半叶占据西方画坛统治地位的官方艺术，从而为掀开西方现代绘画史新的一页，作出了重要贡献。为后人留下了宝贵的艺术财富。应该说莫奈是印象派画家中最先获得成功的人，尽管后来的野兽派、立体派、超现实主义等艺术流派，并未遵循印象派创立的一些原则，但创立这些流派的艺术家，都从印象派那里汲取过营养。\n还要提及的是印象派的理念、技法，本是基于现实的观察而提出的，但是，由于热衷于描写光与色，甚至将其神秘化，从而出现了不顾及现实物象的倾向。莫奈曾说过：作画里，要忘掉你眼前是哪一种物体，想到的只是一小方蓝色、一小块长方形的粉红色、一丝黄色。因此，就出现了画家的创作中的注意力，不是集中于要表现的景物上，而是放到了景物周围的空间环境、光线、烟雾、气流所产生的效果上，或只是局限于表达在一定条件下，景物着光给画家留下的瞬间印象上。因此，就有可能导致只抓住了细微的变化，而失去了解对全局的把握；只反映了微妙的色彩层次，而忽略了景物形体的后果和全局。\n人物评价\n视觉观察方面无疑是一个富有创造性的天才。他善于从光与色的相互关系中发现前人从未发现的某种现象。他把全部注意力都集中在光与色上，从而找到了最适于表达光与色的明度差别变化的形式，他把这种光色明度差别变化从绘画的各种其他因素中抽象出来，把它提到了不可攀登的高度。莫奈的视觉观察是天才的、创造性的、非凡的，可是在这种观察的背后又是什么呢？他所看见的东西同他所感觉和他所想象的东西之间关系又是如何的呢？\n莫奈在1874－1878年间在阿尔让特依所画的一些画可以回答这些问题。如创作于1872年的阿尔让特依的帆船。在这幅图里中间调子代替了色彩对比，但不是借了色彩的混合，而是通过形成一种光的综合作用的色彩分解或组合。黑色已不再出现于画家的调色板，剩下的只是造成明与暗的光谱色彩，它们形成了形的实体。统一的色彩风格很自然地遍及整个画面：远景和近景，物体、水和天空，把这一切改造成为一种美妙动人的景象，而浑然一片、不分层次的空间透视，则把这远景和近景联成一个整体。紫色和黄色的调子同河水和天空的蔚蓝色交织在一起，这些颜色的调子差别把这些自然现象区分得清清楚楚，而且平静如镜的河面，仿佛就成了天穹的基础。几何学的透视已被忘却；它已让空气的不断运动代替了。每一种颜色单独看来十分柔和，它们的整体却又是强烈的；出现在我们面前的是天边焰火弥漫，白昼即将消逝的图景，一条大帆船静静地停在一片灰色的半阴影之中。这是一个幻想家的直观，在这烟雾缭绕、夕阳西下、一片忧郁的气氛之中，莫奈仿佛就是那光的生命，直接参与着它的逐渐熄灭。这是莫奈创作中的丰收时期，是他创作了色彩的传奇。\n莫奈是法国最重要的画家之一，印象派的理论和实践大部分都有他的推广。莫奈擅长光与影的实验与表现技法。他最重要的风格是改变了阴影和轮廓线的画法，在莫奈的画作中看不到非常明确的阴影，看不到突显或平涂式的轮廓线。除此之外，莫奈对于色彩的运用相当细腻，他用许多相同主题的画作来实验色彩与光完美的表达。莫奈曾长期探索光色与空气的表现效果，常常在不同的时间和光线下，对同一对象作多幅的描绘，从自然的光色变幻中抒发瞬间的感觉。\n印象派运动可以看作是19世纪自然主义倾向的巅峰，也可以看作是现代艺术的起点。克劳德·莫奈的名字与印象派的历史密切相连。莫奈对这一艺术环境的形成和他描绘现实的新手法，比其他任何人贡献都多。这一点是毋庸置疑的，印象派的创始人虽说是马奈，但真正使其发扬光大的却是莫奈，因为他对光影之于风景的变化的描绘，已到出神入化的境地。。传记需围绕莫奈的自然主义理念展开，详细描述他成长过程中的重大事件及其艺术追求的形成，对印象派运动的具体贡献，以及其标志性作品《睡莲》系列的创作背景、技法创新和文化意义。此外，请融入一些对于莫奈画作如何影响现代艺术的分析，同时加入法国历史及社会文化背景对莫奈创作的影响。用户身份是艺术教育工作者，希望传记适合作为课堂教学案例，因此请使用易于理解的语言风格，但保留专业深度。具体细化《睡莲》系列画作的创作过程与艺术价值，以及莫奈晚年的生活与其画作的关系。需要增加相关细节，如莫奈与同时代艺术家的关系或关键画展对其职业生涯的影响。",

The air seemed to have solidified, making the already lifeless classroom unbearably stuffy.\n\nHe slumped in his chair, breathing heavily. His breaths sounded like both an accusation and a roar, carrying not just fatigue but also reluctance and loss. Bean-sized sweat drops continuously emerged from his head, rolling to the corners of his eyes, mixing with tears, then sliding down his cheeks and dropping to the floor. The classroom was exceptionally quiet, so quiet that one could hear breathing, making the sound of his sweat drops seem crisp and loud.\n\nThe teacher's eyes tried to comfort him, but he ignored it, just sitting quietly in his seat, his dim eyes staring blankly at the ceiling, saying nothing. At that moment, he seemed like someone lost in a dark maze, unable to find his way. His face, already flushed from intense exercise, combined with his sad and angry mood, became even redder. If you were closer, you might even see his blood flowing.\n\nAfter school, no classmates came to ask him about the basketball game results, as everyone already understood from his lost expression. Undoubtedly, he had lost; no one said anything to him because words at this moment would be like a drop of water in the ocean, creating no ripples, seeming fragile and powerless. Perhaps time would heal all inflamed wounds, and a moment of silence was the best medicine.\n\nThough it was only a one-point difference, he had missed the championship by a hair's breadth. Although there were uncalled fouls by the opponents, although he was the highest scorer of the entire game, it couldn't hide the fact that they had lost.\n\n\"If only the last shot had been more accurate, if that foul hadn't happened, if the game time could have been extended by one minute, even 30 seconds... but there are no 'ifs'.\" He blamed himself, felt frustrated, and regretted deeply, as if everything was his responsibility, trapped in the pain of defeat. That one-point loss seemed magnified countless times, like a needle piercing his heart, preventing him from escaping the quagmire of failure.\n\nHis \"comrades\" remained silent because they feared making things worse, like rubbing salt in his wounds, making him feel even worse. Moreover, everyone was immersed in the pain of losing. Everyone remained quiet, and the classroom's atmosphere remained heavy after school. The originally bright and spacious classroom seemed to grow darker and smaller, enveloped in an oppressive, solemn atmosphere.\n\nFinally, he left the classroom, looking up at the dark sky, which perhaps sympathized with the fall of a hero, expressing its sadness in this way.Please condense the prose content I provided into a short poem with contemporary language style, preserving the core emotional expression while incorporating more specific scenes or details, such as descriptions of certain events or key moments.

Facing exams, believe in yourself, review well, I can do it!\"\n\nThe third speaker was Li Zhuchen from Class 13, who suggested students make daily memorization plans, avoid waste and idleness, and find suitable memorization methods. Additionally, students must maintain adequate rest time, as subjects like Chinese and English require significant memorization and memory capacity, so good rest is essential for better retention.\n\nShe also reminded students to summarize mistakes following teachers' guidance, organize daily knowledge points, and analyze their weaknesses through reflection to achieve proficient knowledge application.\n\nFinally, Zhang Xitong from Class 4 addressed the challenges of studying history, sharing methods and techniques based on students' actual situations. History is a systematic subject requiring mastery of historical knowledge systems across different periods, ability to read and analyze historical materials, and development of critical thinking from a historical perspective.\n\nShe urged students to maintain their passion for history, master scientific learning methods, actively follow teachers' thinking in class, and practice more after class to make progress.\n\nDirector Yan conducted a comprehensive analysis of this exam, covering overall test conditions and strengths and weaknesses in various subjects. He hoped students would learn from exemplary peers' experiences and methods, developing suitable learning approaches based on their situations.\n\nDirector Zhang stated that this monthly test evaluated the previous month's learning. Students who performed well should refine their methods and persist. Those who didn't perform well shouldn't be discouraged but should analyze and summarize from the test, identify weak points, utilize error notebooks, strengthen fundamentals, and face midterm exams with better condition and attitude.\n\nSet ambitious goals in youth, display vigor in struggle.

The article should be written with a rigorous and sincere attitude, featuring a combination of Party theoretical knowledge and personal growth experiences, reflecting my deep understanding and practical thinking on the relationship between politics and justice as a judicial administrative staff member in the industry. Specific requirements are as follows: 1) Clear writing logic and distinct hierarchical structure; 2) Include no less than two paragraphs describing personal experiences or observational cases; 3) Quote at least one Party theory or policy article related to the theme; 4) Length should be around 1500 words; 5) Format should comply with the general format of thought reports, including title, salutation, main text, closing respects, signature, and date.\n\nReference materials for authoritative theories on the relationship between Chinese politics and justice [On the Relationship Between Administrative Power and Judicial Power]\n\nDefinition of Administrative Power: Administrative power refers to the authority exercised by administrative organs in handling administrative affairs. In modern terms, it refers to the power granted by the state constitution and laws to state administrative organs to execute legal norms and implement administrative management activities. It is a component of state power and guarantees social order. In terms of content, administrative power includes national defense, foreign affairs, public security, economic management, and social-cultural management powers. In terms of form, it includes administrative legislation, administrative orders, administrative processing, administrative justice, administrative supervision, administrative enforcement, administrative penalties, and administrative guidance.\n\nDefinition of Judicial Power: Judicial power refers to the authority legally enjoyed by specific state organs to make final judgments on disputes between parties. It derives from constitutional power. Judicial power became an independent form of power alongside legislative and administrative powers after the bourgeois revolution. Judicial power generally has characteristics of being judgmental, passive, neutral, independent, and ultimate.\n\nAdministrative and judicial powers are two distinctly different operational modes of power. Administrative power aims to better manage public affairs, with efficiency as its basic criterion. Judicial power, in contrast, aims to achieve social justice and fairness through case-by-case trials and protection of individual rights. The core values of judicial power lie in procedural due process, substantive individual rights, equal protection under the law, and the concept of equality.\n\nDue to our country's judicial organs often being constrained by local governments in terms of finance and personnel, reform is necessary to ensure true judicial independence. This includes reforming courts' financial sources and personnel appointments to free them from dependence on local administrative organs.\n\nPower balance refers to state organs with restraining authority controlling and limiting other state organs' power exercise through legal evaluation of management issues. The key to ensuring effective checks and balances between judicial and administrative power lies in:\n\n1. Limiting Administrative Power Expansion\n2. Ensuring Judicial Independence\n\nThe essential difference between administrative and judicial power lies in their nature: judicial power is fundamentally about judgment, while administrative power is about management. This leads to several distinctions:\n\n1. Administrative power is proactive while judicial power is passive\n2. Administrative power shows clear tendencies while judicial power maintains neutrality\n3. Administrative power focuses on substantive results while judicial power emphasizes procedural formality\n4. Administrative power is adaptable while judicial power maintains stability\n5. Administrative power is delegable while judicial power is exclusive\n\nTherefore, unclear boundaries between judicial and administrative functions directly affect judicial independence and fairness. Judicial fairness requires independence from administration, and this cannot be achieved through mere partial reforms or additional supervision mechanisms.", "checklist": [{"name": "Political-Judicial Framework Accuracy", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how accurately the response articulates the relationship between political power and judicial independence in the Chinese context, including correct theoretical foundations and Party perspectives.", "1-2": "Contains serious factual errors about the Chinese political-judicial relationship or completely misrepresents Party theory on judicial independence.

公共利益或者个人、组织合法权益造成的危害程度，对数据实行分 类分级保护，并明确加强对重要数据的保护，对关系国家安全、国 民经济命脉、重要民生、重大公共利益等内容的国家核心数据，实 行更加严格的管理制度。《数据安全法》针对重要数据在管理形式和 保护要求上提出了严格和明确的保护制度。在管理形式上，《数据安 全法》采用目录管理的方式，明确将“确定重要数据目录”纳入国 家层面管理事项，国家数据安全工作协调机制统筹协调有关部门制 定重要数据目录。而各地区、各部门制定本地区、本部门及相关行 业、领域的重要数据具体目录，有利于形成国家与各地方、各部门 管理权限之间的合理协调机制，推动重要数据统一认定标准的建立。 在保护要求上，《数据安全法》在一般保护之外，强化了重要数据、 核心数据的保护要求。一是规定数据处理者开展数据处理活动应当 依照法律法规的规定，建立健全全流程数据安全管理制度，组织开 展数据安全教育培训，采取相应的技术措施和其他必要措施，保障 数据安全；二是规定了重要数据处理者“明确数据安全负责人和管 理机构”的义务，要求重要数据处理者在内部作出明确的责任划分， 落实数据安全保护责任；三是规定了重要数据处理者进行风险评估\n—4—\n\n的要求，重要数据处理者应当按照规定对其数据处理活动定期开展 风险评估，并向有关主管部门报送风险评估报告。风险评估报告应 当包括处理的重要数据的种类、数量，开展数据处理活动的情况， 面临的数据安全风险及其应对措施等。\n《数据安全法》建立数据安全风险评估、报告、信息共享、监 测预警和应急处置机制，通过对数据安全风险信息的获取、分析、 研判、预警以及数据安全事件发生后的应急处置，实现数据安全事 前、事中和事后的全流程保障。《数据安全法》第二十二条规定：“国 家建立集中统一、高效权威的数据安全风险评估、报告、信息共享、 监测预警机制。国家数据安全工作协调机制统筹协调有关部门加强 数据安全风险信息的获取、分析、研判、预警工作。”第二十九条规 定：“开展数据处理活动应当加强风险监测，发现数据安全缺陷、漏 洞等风险时，应当立即采取补救措施……”从制度衔接上看，数据 安全风险评估、报告、信息共享、监测预警机制是国家安全制度的 组成部分。《国家安全法》第四章第三节建立了风险预防、评估和预 警的相关制度，规定国家制定完善应对各领域国家安全风险预案。 数据安全风险评估、报告、信息共享、监测预警机制是《国家安全 法》规定的风险预防、评估和预警相关制度在数据安全领域的具体 落实。从保护阶段上看，数据安全风险评估、报告和信息共享构成 了数据安全保护的事前保护义务，监测预警机制构成了数据安全保 护的事中保护义务，数据安全事件的应急处置机制形成了对数据安\n—5—\n\n全的事后保护。 《数据安全法》对数据的出境管理进行了补充和完善。一是针\n对重要数据完善了跨境数据流动制度，《数据安全法》在《网络安全 法》第三十七条的基础之上，规定“其他数据处理者在中华人民共 和国境内运营中收集和产生的重要数据的出境安全管理办法，由国 家网信部门会同国务院有关部门制定。”既与《网络安全法》相衔接， 也实现了对所有重要数据出境的安全保障。二是通过出口管制的形 式限制了管制物项数据的出口，《数据安全法》第二十五条规定“国 家对与维护国家安全和利益、履行国际义务相关的属于管制物项的 数据依法实施出口管制”，明确将数据出口管制纳入数据安全管理工 作中，实现了与《出口管制法》的衔接，有利于从维护国家安全的 角度限制相关数据的出境，对整体跨境数据流动制度进行补充。三 是对外国司法、执法机构调取我国数据的情况进行了规定。《数据安 全法》第三十六条首先明确“中华人民共和国主管机关根据有关法 律和中华人民共和国缔结或者参加的国际条约、协定，或者按照平 等互惠原则，处理外国司法或者执法机构关于提供数据的请求。”同 时规定“非经中华人民共和国主管机关批准”不得向境外执法或司 法机构提供境内数据，并对违法违规提供数据的行为，明确了包括 警告、罚款等在内的行政处罚措施。这一制度的设置体现了对于合 法合规向外国司法或者执法机构提供数据的重视，明确了我国处理 外国司法或者执法机构关于提供数据请求的一般原则，同时也是依\n—6—\n\n法应对少数国家肆意滥用长臂管辖，防范我国境内数据被外国司法 或执法机构不当获取。\n数据交易制度的确立使得数据依法有序流动成为现实。数据是 数字经济时代的重要生产要素，而数据交易则是满足数据供给和需 要的最主要方式，明确数据交易的法律地位，是满足现实需求、助 力数字经济发展的重要表现，是当前数据交易制度发展的制度基础。 《数据安全法》第十九条规定国家建立健全数据交易管理制度，规 范数据交易行为，培育数据交易市场。此外，《数据安全法》还在第 三十三条规定了数据交易中介服务机构的主要义务，规定从事数据 交易中介服务的机构在提供交易中介服务时，应当要求数据提供方 说明数据来源，审核交易双方的身份，并留存审核、交易记录。《数 据安全法》为数据交易制度提供了兼顾安全和发展的原则性规定， 有利于在保障安全基础上，促进数据有序流动，激励相关主体参与 到数据交易活动中来，充分释放数据红利。\n—7—\n\n中华人民共和国数据安全法\n（共七章五十五条，自 2021 年 9 月 1 日起施行）\n第一章 总 则\n第一条 为了规范数据处理活动，保障数据安全，促进数据开

治国、依法行政的关键和前提，没有依法执政，中国要实现建设法治国家、法治政府、法治社会的目标和任务是不可 能的。 各级党委依法执政提出的具体要求是多方面的，笔者认为最有价值的有以下十项： 从制度上、程序上规范党委与人大、政府、政协、司法机关以及人民团体的关系，确定“党委在同级各种组织中 发挥领导核心作用”，但不能取代，而应支持同级各种组织依法履行职能，特别是依法支持司法机关依法独立公正行 使司法权； 保障“各级党组织必须在宪法和法律范围内活动”，牢固树立“法律面前人人平等、制度面前没有特权、制度约束 没有例外”的观念； 尊重宪法确立的人民民主制度，党委对地方重大事务的决策和主张，凡属于人大及其常委会职权范围内的，应向 本级人大及其常委会提出建议，“由本级人大及其常委会作出决议或决定”，对涉及经济社会发展全局的重大事项，要 广泛征求民意，充分进行协商和协调； 推行党务公开，除依法应保密的事项外，党内事务除应当通过一定方式和途径向党员主动公开外，党员还可按规 定向党的基层组织申请公开； 建立健全党内情况通报和党内事务听证咨询制度，“党委常委会和全委会开会可邀请党代表列席，讨论涉及公众 利益、需要公民广泛知晓和参与的事项的党委常务会议，甚至可以公开举行，邀请党员、人大代表、政协委员或公民 列席旁听”； 加强党委新闻发布制度建设，高度重视互联网民意表达，对网上反映的涉及党委工作的热点问题，及时回应，“提 高在信息网络化条件下的执政能力和水平”； 建立党内规范性文件备案审查制度，接受备案的机关应当对报送备案的规范性文件进行审查，“对超越职权、同 法律法规或中央方针政策相抵触的，应当作出处理”； 加强党内监督，以领导干部特别是各级领导班子中的“一把手”为监督重点对象，监督内容包括人事权、审批权、 财政资金分配权等各种公权力的行使。 《法治湖南建设纲要》通过“地方性知识”对执政党依法执政的具体路径所进行的探索难能可贵。因为在中国这样 的社会主义国家实行执政党依法执政，没有现成的模式可循，必须依靠我们自己探索。）\n\n依法治国需要进行科学规划\n社会主义法治国家建设进程需要一份“路线图”。这份“路线图”就是对法治这一宏伟目标的最终到达作出战略 性规划,设定数个不同的实现阶段,以及每一阶段所要达到的阶段性目标,指明每一阶段的具体任务和衡量指标体系 法律作为一种根植于特定历史时期和社会经济文化环境的制度,反映了人们在相应时期和背景下的社会需求和价 值取向。中国的法治道路应当是从中国的现实需要出发的,不能也不应全面照搬西方。从历史上看,一些西方法治国家 曾将其法治体制移植到亚洲、非洲等殖民地,但从结果来看,并不能说完全获得成功。\n\n这在一定程度上说明了法治和文化、社会发展程度之间的紧密联系。笔者认为,西方的法治作为一种治理模式,是 其长期实践经验积累的结果,他们的法治理念更多地关注西方社会形态、历史文化传统,未必都适用于东方社会。 法治建设需要战略规划 我国自改革开放以来,经过三十多年的努力,法治建设所取得的成就是巨大的。 从立法方面来看,我们用三十年的时 间走过了西方国家数百年的道路,尤其是有中国特色的社会主义法律体系已经形成。 从司法方面来看,司法制度基本完善,司法已经成为最终解决纠纷的机制,职业化的法官队伍也已经初具规模。 从执法方面来看,依法行政、建立法治政府已经成为行政机关基本的工作规范和目标。 但是,我们确实也应当看到,我国正处于转型时期,这个转型不仅是从农业社会向工业社会,从计划经济向市场经济 的转型,而且,也是从人治社会向法治社会的转型。在转型社会中,必然存在两种体制的特征。 三十多年经济的高度发展,在经济实力大幅提升、人民生活得到很大改善的同时,也带来了大量社会矛盾和社会问 题。解决这些社会问题只有通过法治,也必须依靠法治。但这并不是说实现法治就能够一蹴而就,也不是说有了法治就 能一夜之间解决所有问题,在我们这种转型国家中实现法治必须依据法治本身的规律和我国的现实情况科学规划和稳 步推进,才能够最终实现我们的目的。 为了推进法治建设,我们需要一个战略规划；在运作层面上,法治主要是一种法律秩序和法律实现的过程及状态。 法治本身就是一个动态的过程,因此法治建设的推进也必须在党的领导下,有序稳步推进。 为此,社会主义法治国家建设 进程需要一份“路线图”。这份“路线图”就是对法治这一宏伟目标的最终到达作出战略性规划,设定数个不同的实现 阶段,以及每一阶段所要达到的阶段性目标,指明每一阶段的具体任务和衡量指标体系。 制定这一战略规划的必要性在于:一方面,通过战略规划可以实现向法治国转型中的社会稳定有序。法治不能大跃 进,不能脱离国家社会发展水平。在推进法治的过程中,必然会遇到各种困难和障碍,甚至可能遭遇社会动荡。如果有了 战略规划,我们就可以按照所设想的步骤逐步推进,并可以制定预案,即在总体法治战略规划制定之后,各级机关、各部 门也应当围绕本部门的各项任务,确定本部门具体落实计划以及相关应急预案。这样,通过富有前瞻性的战略规划以及 相关配套政策、措施,就可以有效避免或者缓解对社会可能带来的冲击。 另一方面,通过战略规划也有助于推进社会主义民主政治的不断完善。 在现代社会,民主和法治是始终不可分离的。 民主是依法治国必备的政治基础,没有民主,就不可能使法律体现充分体现民意,法律在实践中就难以甚至无法得到社 会大众的认同。 战略规划推进法治建设切实可行 通过分解法治实现过程中的步骤和措施,制定战略规划是完全可行的。法治目标的实现,不可能完全依照边实践、 边摸索的逻辑,而需要事先作出战略性规划。 这是因为,法治作为人类文明发展的普遍性成果,在数百年的法律发展史中 已经形成了一些具有共性的规律和路径；不同法律传统的法治仍然具有一些基本的共同原则。 从我国法治建设的实践来看,采取规划的方式推进改革是行之有效的。 从立法来看,我们历来都有立法规划,立法规 划确保了法律体系的科学性和完备性,从而稳步推进了社会主义法律体系的形成。 从行政执法来看,国务院在 2004 年颁 布了 《全面推进依法行政实施纲要》 ,这一纲要就其性质而言,就是依法行政的规划,各级行政机关正是按照纲要的要求, 推进依法行政和建设法治政府,从而稳步地推进了政府法治建设。从司法来看,最高人民法院在司法改革方面一直采取 规划的方式,曾经颁布了《人民法院第二个五年改革纲要》等,系统部署了 2004 年至 2008 年法院改革各项措施,启动人 民法院新一轮的全面改革,为司法改革的有序推进发挥了重要作用。但是,从全国范围来,我们缺乏全面推进法治的规 划。 法制建设战略规划的目标\n\n笔者认为,制定法治建设的战略规划,首先就要明确宪法确立的“依法治国,建设社会主义法治国家”的目标,在此 目标之下,可以将法治建设的内容分解为如下几个部分,并分别拟定规划,确立各阶段发展目标: 第一,宪政制度建设规划。 依法治国,首先必须是依宪治国。 法治的形式性要求是,政府所行使的一切权力都必须来 源于宪法的授权,并受宪法的制约。实现依宪治国,不仅要全面贯彻和实施宪法,还要建立和完善宪法监督机制,使一切 违反宪法的行为都得到及时纠正。在此项任务中,可以具体分解为:公权力的分配和监督,公民基本权利的保护,进一步 完善宪法的监督和实施制度、预决算公开和监督制度、选举制度的完善等。 第二,立法任务规划。在社会主义法律体系建立之后,我国还有很多具体立法工作有待完善,例如,加快民法典的制 定、完善有关社会保障法、对程序法进行必要的修改等等。再如,通过劳动和社会保障制度的完善,来实现公民的社会 性权利。 第三,司法改革规划。在司法方面,我们应当逐步建立公正、权威、高效的司法机构,保障司法机关依法独立行使审 判权。我们应当继续推进法官职业化,完善诉讼程序、审判监督、执行程序、法律援助、冤假错案的纠正与赔偿等一系 列制度；进一步完善法院经费保障、法官薪酬、培训等相关司法保障制度；进一步完善执行程序,化解“执行难”、 “执 行乱”的问题。 第四,依法行政与建立法治政府。一方面,要应当进一步界定政府与市场、社会的关系,厘定政企关系、政事关系； 进一步压缩政府审批权限、明确行政权力界限、规范行政行为程序、加强行政信息公开,切实维护公民对行政机关的监 督权利。另一方面,要进一步加强对行政相对人的保护,完善行政诉讼、复议等制度,逐步扩大对行政行为的司法审查范 围和强度。 第五,完善对私权的保护机制。公民权利的保护是法治建设的重要目标,这其中不仅包括公民的宪法基本权利的保 护,也包括其他权利的保护。这就需要进一步完善立法、切实落实宪法关于基本权利的规定；努力降低犯罪率,规范多 元纠纷解决机制,化解各种社会矛盾,充分保障公民的财产人身安全和私权。 第六,法治的关键还在于引导公民树立社会主义法治理念、养成遵纪守法的良好习惯。为此,应当进一步加强普法 和法治教育的力度,积极探索法治宣传新手段的运用,进一步改革和完善法学教育以及司法考试制度,为国家法治建设 培养合格的法律人才。\n\n社会管理创新须遵循法治轨道\n加强和创新社会管理，是我们党正确面对当前经济社会发展的形势作出的重大决策部署。加强和创新社会管理， 必须遵循法治思想，在依法治国方略指引下，正确实施法律，严格依法办事，维护社会公平正义。 一、法治是社会管理创新的前提和保障 社会管理是国家为达到预期目的，促进社会的协调运转，通过行使国家权力，对社会系统的组成部分、社会生活 的不同领域以及社会共同事务进行组织、 协调、 服务和控制的过程。 法治对社会管理创新有着重要的促进和保障作用， 社会管理创新离不开法治。 （一）法治是最佳的社会管理模式。亚里士多德说：“法治应当优于一人之治”。长期以来，中国在治国理政及社 会管理方面，一直奉行“人治”，主张“贤人政治”，把治理国家、管理社会事务的希望寄托在当权者个人身上。从历史 上看，一些贤者也确实把国家社会事务管理得井井有条，出现了诸如“文景之治”、“贞观之治”等盛世，然而，人治终 究难以使社会长治久安， 甚至会产生一些不可挽回的灾难。 历史和实践证明， 法治是目前人类社会探索出的治理国家、 管理社会事务的最合理的模式，在没有其他更合理的模式出现之前，法治就是最优的社会管理模式。 （二）法治是社会管理的重要手段和有力保障。任何社会都不可能没有矛盾纠纷，而解决矛盾的方式在不同的社 会治理模式下会呈现出不同的状态。但不管何种状态，任何社会矛盾的解决不外乎两种方式：一是以科学有效的社会\n\n机制在体系内和平理性地化解；二是不能在体系内化解，只有引发社会革命解决。作为执政党，决不希望社会动荡。 胡锦涛总书记指出：“法治是以和平理性的方式解决矛盾纠纷的最佳途径。”在法治状态下，公权力受到制约，公民的 合法权利能够得到宪法和法律的有效保障和救济，人与人、人与社会之间的矛盾都在理性的法律程序下得到妥善化解 和终结，并能对矛盾纠纷解决方案及未来生活产生一个基本明确的预期，从而使社会矛盾得到自我消弭，社会管理秩 序得到正常运转，社会得以和谐稳定发展。这正是加强和创新社会管理的根本目的。 （三）落实依法治国方略是社会管理创新的必然要求。法律是党的成熟政策的法律化，是党的政治智慧、治理国 家经验的法律化，是党所代表的人民意志的法律化。因此，严格执行法律，就是严格执行党的路线、方针、政策，就 是执行党的意志，而绝不是在法律之外寻求权变之策。当前，社会转型时期，社会矛盾纠纷的产生和发展虽有多方面 的原因，但没有依法办事，执法不严、执法不公是众多矛盾纠纷产生、发展、升级的主要原因。解决这些矛盾纠纷， 协调社会关系，规范社会行为，应当深入贯彻落实科学发展观，全面落实依法治国基本方略，以法律手段为最主要的 解决手段和第一解决手段，综合运用政治、经济及其他手段。 二、推进社会管理创新必须正确实施法律 徒法不足以自行。加强和创新社会管理，推进社会主义法治建设，必须依赖于法律的正确实施。 （一）正确实施法律是社会主义法治的应有之意。社会主义法治的基本要求被具体概括和表述为“有法可依、有 法必依、执法必严、违法必究”十六字方针。这既是我国健全社会主义法制建设的指导方针，也是我国落实依法治国 方略、建设法治国家的基本要求。从法的实施角度看，有法可依属于立法范畴，有法必依、执法必严、违法必究属于 法的实施范畴。 （二）正确实施法律是维护社会秩序的需要。通过正当立法程序制定出来的法律体现了党的意志和人民的意志的 统一，是规范人民权利义务、分配社会资源和利益的规范性文件。实施法律，就是要把这些抽象的权利义务变成具体 的权利义务，从而发挥调整法的调整社会秩序功能。如果法律不能得到有效实施，公民的合法权利就会无法得到有效 保护，人民群众就会更加不相信法律，不相信执法部门，有了纠纷也可能不愿意提交司法部门解决，而会选择私力救 济渠道，如私了等，由此可能会产生更多的纠纷，简单的矛盾甚至会复杂化。 （三）正确实施法律在社会主义法律体系形成后显得更为重要。多年来，全国人大及其常委会、国务院及其他有 权机关制定了大量的法律法规、自治条例、单行条例等等广义上的“法”，立法无论数量还是法律种类及内容都有了较 大的改善。去年年初，中央政治局常委、全国人大常委会委员长吴邦国郑重宣布，有中国特色的社会主义法律体系已 经基本形成。法律体系形成后，我国法治建设的重点和方向就转向了确保法律的正确实施。在此背景下，加强和推进 社会管理创新，应当沿着法治轨道，积极促进法律的正确实施，依靠法律规范公民权利义务，分配利益关系，化解矛 盾纠纷。 三、人民法院在法律实施过程中担负着重要职责 司法的中立性、统一性、专业性、公开性以及司法机关依法独立行使职权等禀赋，决定了其在社会管理中具有独 特的价值。人民法院的功能涉及到方方面面，但其最主要、最基本的功能是权利救济、公权制约和终结纠纷功能。这 三大功能充分体现了司法在社会管理中的独特价值，也充分体现了人民法院在法律实施中的重要职责。 （一）人民法院是重要的法律实施主体。法律实施，是指法律在社会生活中被人们实际地贯彻执行，包括执法、 司法、守法和法律监督各个环节，其中司法是法律与其他社会系统相联系的纽带和中介，是实现法的既定目的的重要 形式，在法律实施中发挥着至关重要的作用。人民法院一方面通过执法办案进行着具体的法律条款适用，另一方面， 通过对公权力的制约， 对具体行政执法活动进行着法律上的监督和规范， 以国家赋予的司法职权保障着法律有效实施， 是重要的法律实施主体。 （二）法院职能作用发挥情况影响着法律实施效果。“法院是法律帝国的首都。”人民法院在具体的执法办案过程 中，一方面，通过严格依法裁判，依法办事，使法律赋予公民的抽象的权利义务转化为具体的权利义务，使当事人及 社会群众体会到法的作用、价值，另一方面，通过能动司法，弥补立法的缺陷和不足，弘扬社会主义法治精神，促进 形成学法用法守法的社会氛围。 如果法院职能作用发挥得不够充分， 法律对社会生活的具体作用就无法得到充分展示。\n\n（三）司法功能诠释着法律的功能和价值。一般来说，法律具有自由、正义、秩序等社会基本价值，并具有分配 社会利益、解决社会纠纷、实施社会管理等功能，而司法则具有权利救济、公权制约、终结纠纷等功能。司法通过救 济公民权利、制约公权力、裁判纠纷等使社会正义得以实现，正常的社会管理秩序得以维护。在法律实施中，司法功 能直接诠释着法律的功能和价值。 如前所述，法治是社会管理创新的前提和保障，推进社会管理创新有赖于法律的正确实施，而人民法院又在法律 实施中担负着重要的职责。由此可以推论，加强和创新社会管理，应当遵循法治轨道，充分发挥人民法院的职能作用。 协调社会关系、化解社会矛盾、促进社会公正、应对社会风险、保持社会稳定等社会管理具体任务的实现，都与人民 法院息息相关，离不开法院的积极作为，且实践中法院通过调处纠纷、打击犯罪、支持行政机关履行社会管理职责、 延伸司法服务等方面的具体举措，为进一步加强和推进社会管理作出了积极贡献。理论分析及多年的司法实践均表明 人民法院在推进社会管理创新方面扮演着重要角色，人民法院是社会管理创新的重要参与者和推动者，在解决矛盾纠 纷、维护社会和谐稳定、促进社会发展方面有着独特和不可替代的优势和特点，在推进社会管理创新中发挥着其他组 织、机关不可替代的重要作用", "checklist": [{"name": "内容全面性与结构严谨度", "criteria_description":

These changes may be gradual or sudden, but they all shape our inner world. Through the story of an ordinary person, this article will deeply analyze their psychological journey from confusion to self-awareness, hoping to bring some inspiration to readers.\n\n1. The Starting Point of Confusion\n\nLi Ming (pseudonym) is an ordinary office worker who works nine-to-five daily, leading a seemingly stable but passionless life. He always feels his life is like a preset program, unchanging and lacking meaning. During quiet nights, Li Ming often falls into deep confusion, contemplating the meaning of life and his future.\n\nAt this stage, Li Ming's psychological state is typical of the \"confusion period.\" He feels puzzled, helpless, and even begins to doubt his own value. This confusion isn't accidental but stems from his dissatisfaction with his current life state and uncertainty about the future.\n\n2. Inner Struggle\n\nAs time passed, Li Ming's sense of confusion intensified. He began trying different ways to find answers, such as reading philosophy books, attending psychological lectures, and even trying new hobbies. However, these efforts didn't seem to lead him to real answers but instead made him more confused.\n\nDuring this struggle, Li Ming's inner world experienced intense fluctuations. Sometimes he felt excited, as if about to touch the truth; other times he fell into despair, feeling all efforts were in vain. This inner struggle was an important stage in his psychological change and a necessary path toward self-awareness.\n\n3. The Turning Point of Self-exploration\n\nBy chance, Li Ming attended a psychological workshop about self-awareness. Through a series of psychological tests and group activities, he began to deeply understand his personality, values, and potential abilities. This experience became the turning point in his psychological transformation.\n\nThrough self-exploration, Li Ming gradually realized that his confusion stemmed from living according to others' expectations while ignoring his own true needs and desires. He began learning to listen to his inner voice and pay attention to his feelings and needs rather than blindly pursuing externally recognized success.\n\n4. The Awakening of Self-awareness\n\nAs self-exploration deepened, Li Ming gradually found his position. He realized that everyone's life is unique, and there's no need to compare with or imitate others. He began planning his life according to his interests and values, no longer swayed by external evaluations.\n\nAt this stage, Li Ming's psychological state underwent a qualitative leap. He emerged from confusion and struggle to welcome the awakening of self-awareness. He became more confident, determined, and full of passion and expectation for life.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nLi Ming's story is a microcosm of many people's psychological changes. In life's journey, we all encounter moments of confusion and struggle, but these moments drive us to continuously explore ourselves and grow. Through deep analysis of psychological changes, we can better understand ourselves and find inner peace and strength.\n\nAs Li Ming experienced, when we bravely face inner confusion and struggle, actively exploring ourselves, we will eventually find our own answers and path. May everyone find their own light and future on life's journey.", "checklist": [{"name": "Character Analysis Depth", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the depth and sophistication of the psychological analysis of the literary character, including developmental stages, motivations, and transformations.", "1-2": "No meaningful psychological analysis of any literary character;

Please arrange the content framework appropriately to reflect the user's perspective and research direction.\n\nReference materials for domestic and international research reports and authoritative data sources regarding the importance of preschool education: Preschool Education Survey Report\n\nWith the changing population structure in China, more families are emphasizing education, especially the importance of preschool education, leading to expanding market demand and development in preschool education. Recently, we conducted a survey on preschool education and collected data and insights aimed at helping parents make better decisions while providing information about market dynamics and parental needs to preschool institutions.\n\n1. Development Trends in Preschool Education\nAccording to our survey, preschool education in China is continuously developing. By 2020, the preschool education coverage rate in China will reach approximately 85%. This indicates that preschool education is important for both parents and children, and child education has become an essential part of family development plans.\n\n2. Parents' Focus Areas\nThe survey found that parents are most concerned about teaching staff quality, curriculum design, and tuition fees in preschool education. Teaching staff quality ranks highest at 57%, followed by curriculum design at 20% and tuition fees at 18%. The emphasis on teaching staff quality highlights the importance of educational quality to parents.\n\n3. Parents' Methods for Choosing Preschool Institutions\nRegarding how parents choose preschool institutions, the survey found that most parents gather information through internet searches, recommendations from friends and family, offline exhibitions, and campus visits. Internet searches account for the highest proportion at 48%.\n\n4. Parents' Evaluation Criteria for Preschool Institutions\nThe survey also found that parents focus more on teaching quality and learning environment when choosing preschool institutions. Teaching quality accounts for 51%, while learning environment accounts for 30%.\n\n5. Brand Reputation and Reviews of Preschool Institutions\nRegarding brand evaluation, we concluded that brand reputation is crucial in the preschool education market and parents' minds. Through analyzing vast amounts of data, we found that larger brands like Montessori and English Cheese generally have higher reputation ratings, while smaller, regional educational institutions have more localized positive reviews. Meanwhile, smaller educational institutions generally receive high praise from parents of currently enrolled children.\n\nConclusion\nThe preschool education market is developing rapidly, and families' emphasis on and need for preschool education continues to increase. Through this survey report, parents can gain a more comprehensive understanding of market demands, selection criteria, and reputation factors, helping them make better choices in selecting preschool institutions and providing better guarantees for their children's future.

{"index": 653, "domain1": "Academic & Engineering", "domain2": "Conclusion", "query": "Based on the Basic Evaluation\n1. The overall airport layout is generally reasonable. The construction and development of most airports are based on aviation transport market demands, initially forming an airport system that aligns with our national conditions and strength, playing an important role in promoting and guiding national economic and social development, strengthening national defense, and safeguarding national security. Using ground transportation of 100 kilometers or 1.5-hour drive time as the airport service radius indicator, existing airports can provide aviation services to 52% of county-level administrative units, covering areas that account for 61% of the national population and 82% of the national GDP.\n\n2. Airport regional layout generally matches the economic geographic pattern. The quantity, scale, and density of airport regional distribution basically align with China's regional economic and social development level and economic geographic pattern. Civil airports show regional development trends, initially forming three major regional airport clusters centered on Beijing (North China, Northeast), Shanghai (East China), and Guangzhou (Central South), while two regional airport clusters centered on Chengdu, Chongqing, and Kunming (Southwest) and Xi'an, Urumqi (Northwest) are taking shape. The airport cluster effect is gradually emerging, playing an important role in driving regional economic and social development, expanding opening-up, and enhancing urban development potential and influence.\n\n3. The functional hierarchy of the airport system is becoming clearer. China's civil aviation transport network, combining hub-and-spoke spatial layout with city pairs, is gradually forming. The functional hierarchy of the airport system is becoming clearer and more rational, with increasing international competitiveness. A number of major airports are improving their comprehensive functions and operational capabilities. The central position of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou hub airports is increasingly prominent. The backbone role of provincial capitals or major city airports such as Kunming, Chengdu, Xi'an, Urumqi, Shenyang, Wuhan, Chongqing, Dalian, Harbin, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen has been further strengthened.\n\n4. Air transport's position in the comprehensive transportation system continues to rise. Based on expanding airport layout and improving aviation network, air transport, with its advantages in speed, convenience, comfort, and safety, is gradually taking a dominant position in medium and long-distance passenger transport, international passenger and cargo transport, intercity rapid transport, and specific regional transport. During the \"10th Five-Year Plan\" period, passenger throughput, cargo and mail throughput, and aircraft movements at civil aviation airports increased annually by 16.3%, 9.6%, and 11.7% respectively.\n\nExisting Problems\nThe main contradictions and problems in airport layout include: 1) Insufficient number of airports and limited regional service coverage; 2) Lack of coordination within the civil aviation airport system; 3) Insufficient integration between airport development and urban planning, military aviation planning, and other transport mode planning; 4) Most medium and large airports are at or near capacity with incomplete comprehensive functions, falling short of requirements for improving aviation safety assurance capability and transport service quality., please summarize three key points regarding the impact on airport planning and construction projects. The summary should have clear structure, accurate information, and be written in concise and understandable language.

I am the director of the Comprehensive Division of the Anti-Organized Crime Office in a county police department of Shandong Province. The specific requirements are as follows:\n\n1. Strictly follow the format specifications of the \"Regulations on Party and Government Organs Document Processing,\" and organize the content into four sections: \"Current Work Progress, Main Achievements, Existing Problems, and Next-Step Work Plan\";\n\n2. Focus on describing the campaign results (including specific data such as the number of criminal organizations eliminated, suspects arrested, and amount of illegal gains confiscated) and improvement in public satisfaction (combined with public opinion survey data);\n\n3. The main body of the text should be around 3,000-4,000 words;\n\n4. Based on my experience in supervising daily operations of the Anti-Organized Crime Office, highlight the distinctive features and innovative practices in this special campaign.\n\nThe detailed data from the latest public satisfaction survey, important documents and meeting spirits from superior departments regarding the anti-organized crime work refer to Shandong Province:\n·Education: Public satisfaction reaches 85%, with parents giving highest ratings to school education quality, teacher qualifications, and campus safety. However, some parents report excessive homework and heavy academic burden on students.\n·Healthcare: Satisfaction rate is 82%, with people generally satisfied with doctors' medical skills and service attitude, hospital facilities and environment, and medical costs. However, issues such as insufficient grassroots medical resources and inconvenient medical treatment processes still exist.\n·Transportation: Satisfaction rate is 78%, with high public evaluation of public transportation facilities and services, but urban traffic congestion remains serious.\n·Environment: Satisfaction rate is 75%, with high public evaluation of urban air quality and water quality, but average ratings for urban noise and waste management.\n·Public Security: Complete data not provided, but overall public security situation is good.\n\nThe Shandong Provincial Public Security Department held a meeting to promote the normalized anti-gang campaign across provincial public security organs. Li Wei, Deputy Provincial Governor, Party Secretary and Director of the Public Security Department, attended and spoke at the meeting, emphasizing the need to resolutely implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core. Under the strong leadership of the provincial party committee, government, and Ministry of Public Security, they should fully play the leading role of public security organs, maintaining unchanged determination, standards, and intensity to push the normalized anti-gang campaign to deeper levels and continuously achieve new results satisfactory to the Party and the people.\n\nThe meeting pointed out that since the normalization of the anti-gang campaign, provincial public security organs have resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee's decisions and deployments, maintaining high pressure against criminal gangs, achieving significant results, effectively consolidating the achievements of the special campaign, and making important contributions to maintaining national security and social stability. They must elevate their political position and enhance their sense of responsibility and mission in conducting the normalized anti-gang campaign. They should quickly align their thoughts and actions with the requirements of the provincial party committee, government, and Ministry of Public Security, fully recognize the significance of anti-gang work, maintain a resolute attitude, strike hard, and strictly punish according to law, unswervingly carrying the normalized anti-gang struggle through to the end.\n\nThe meeting emphasized the need to persist in long-term efforts and resolutely crack down on major criminal gang organizations. They should clarify main targets, combine with the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection's concentrated rectification of corruption issues affecting the masses, focus on \"four strikes and one pursuit\" special actions, and severely crack down on various types of local tyrants and network criminal activities. They should strengthen key breakthroughs, supervise key cases, fully solve major gang cases, ensure thorough investigation, seriously handle public tip-offs about gang-related leads, ensure follow-up on each case, and earn public trust through solid work. They should deepen the strike against financial assets and protective umbrellas, pursuing investigation and \"cutting off financial blood supply\" simultaneously, legally seizing gang-related assets, and thoroughly investigating suspected protective networks.\n\nThe meeting emphasized the need to maintain proactive offense and resolutely eliminate gang crime in its embryonic state. They should forcefully suppress new types of internet-related crimes, study the trends of gang crime spreading to cyberspace, focus on six main forms including extortion through nude chat, loan schemes, and cyber troublemaking, comprehensively analyze evidence, and seek maximum results. They should comprehensively enhance proactive detection capabilities, conduct concentrated investigations, rolling investigations, and key point investigations with quick response and strikes. In conjunction with the \"Summer Action,\" they should quickly investigate and solve ten types of criminal activities such as provocations, group fights, and extortion. They should concentrate on rectifying problem areas, improve mechanisms for investigating and rectifying key social security areas, routinely conduct thorough investigations of leads and case reviews, and continuously carry out special clean-up operations to timely cut off chains of disorder leading to evil and evil leading to organized crime.\n\nThe meeting pointed out the need to persist in comprehensive governance and resolutely eliminate the soil where gang forces breed. They should fully implement the \"Anti-Organized Crime Law,\" establish and improve the prevention and governance system using the central \"Two Offices\" Opinion and provincial measures as tools to thoroughly eliminate criminal soil. They should promote governance in key industries and better implement regulatory responsibilities of supervising departments. They should strengthen the connection between administrative law enforcement and criminal justice, increase efforts to govern black and grey industries, and effectively plug regulatory loopholes. Regarding issues of \"village tyrants\" and other gang forces interfering with rural grassroots political power, they should actively cooperate with organization and civil affairs departments to continuously deepen prevention, strikes, and rectification, serving rural revitalization and development.

Format requirement: Written according to standard court defense statement format, including court address, case overview, fact analysis, legal application, and defense opinions\n4. Key content:\n- Focus on discussing how adverse weather conditions (rain, snow, low visibility, etc.) affected the accident\n- Detailed explanation of the defendant's active rescue efforts and compensation after the accident\n- Emphasize how these circumstances should be considered as mitigating factors in sentencing\n5. Identity requirement: I am the defendant's defense attorney, need to demonstrate a professional and persuasive defense position\n\nThe specific case details, meteorological data records at the time of the incident, relevant legal provisions, especially regulations regarding mitigating circumstances for traffic accident crimes, refer to Around 4:00 PM on August 11, 2012, a car driven by Zhu collided with a motorcycle operated by Chen, who was driving without a license. The front of the motorcycle collided with the right side of the car, resulting in Chen's injury. Traffic police determined that Zhu bore primary responsibility for the accident, while Chen bore secondary responsibility. Further investigation revealed that Zhu was a driver employed by Mao, and while the car was registered under Liu's name, the actual owner was Mao. Chen subsequently filed a lawsuit against the registered owner Liu, actual owner Mao, driver Zhu, and the insurance company, seeking compensation of over 3,400 yuan.\n\nFrom August 18 to 22, 2024, due to the combined effects of a northeastern cold vortex, subtropical high pressure, and Typhoon \"Lark,\" Huludao City in Liaoning Province experienced sustained heavy rainfall of historic proportions in terms of volume, intensity, scope, and destructive power. The maximum precipitation during this period reached 540.0 mm, with a maximum daily rainfall of 527.7 mm, breaking Liaoning Province's record. The overall intensity of this rainfall reached an exceptionally strong level, making it the strongest rainfall event in the Huludao area since meteorological records began in 1951. Over 100,000 people were affected, numerous national and provincial highways and rural roads were damaged or interrupted to varying degrees, and hundreds of bridges were damaged.\n\nFirst, Article 133 of the Criminal Law clearly stipulates the basic sentencing standards for traffic accident crimes.

However, under specific conditions, traffic accident crimes may be subject to lighter penalties according to law.\n\nAccording to relevant legal interpretations and judicial practice, circumstances that warrant lighter penalties for traffic accident crimes mainly include:\n\nSurrender and confession: If the perpetrator surrenders immediately after the accident, honestly confesses to the criminal facts, or demonstrates other acts of surrender, they may receive lighter penalties or reduced sentences. This shows the perpetrator's recognition of their criminal behavior and willingness to bear legal responsibility, reflecting their remorseful attitude.\n\nActive compensation and forgiveness: If the perpetrator actively compensates for the economic losses suffered by the victims and obtains forgiveness from the victims or their close relatives, this can also serve as an important factor for lighter punishment.

Synthetic drugs: These drugs are mainly manufactured through chemical synthesis, including methamphetamine (ice), ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine), ketamine (K powder), triazolam, GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate), LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), etc. They typically have stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effects, and users often take them orally or nasally, with high concealment.\n2. Cannabis drugs: Cannabis is a natural drug with THC as its main component. Cannabis drugs in China include marijuana, cannabis resin, and cannabis oil. Long-term cannabis use can lead to intellectual decline, malnutrition, and mental disorders.\n3. Hallucinogens: These substances cause hallucinations, including LSD, GHB, and ecstasy.

内容框架：\n- 开篇需要简要交代战争背景和双方实力对比\n- 按照'战前准备-初期交锋-中期混战-最终决战'的结构展开\n- 每个阶段都要有细节描写，包括将领调度、士兵心理、法术对决等\n\n3. 个性化需求：\n- 希望融入个人对古代军阵、兵器的了解\n- 在玄幻元素中体现真实的军事策略\n- 结合个人玩过的战争策略游戏的经验\n\n古代著名战役的细节描写，古代兵书中关于军阵调度的记载参考官渡之战‌是东汉末年曹操与袁绍两大割据势力之间的一场决定性战斗，发生在公元200年，地点在今天的河南省中牟县东北的官渡地区。这场战役不仅是我国军事史上以少胜多的典型案例，还深刻影响了后来的历史进程。‌\n\n背景\n汉献帝建安元年（196年），曹操迎天子至许都，奉天子以令天下，威势大增。他先后击败吕布、袁术，占据了兖州、徐州、司隶以及部分豫州、扬州寿春一带。建安四年（199年），袁绍战胜公孙瓒，占据了幽州、冀州、青州、并州，尽有黄河以北之地，意欲南向以争天下。如此，曹操与袁绍的最终决战无法避免。\n\n过程\n建安五年（200年）正月，曹操出人意料地先进攻徐州的刘备。二月，袁绍率步兵十余万、骑兵一万，进军黎阳，准备渡河，同时派遣颜良进攻白马。四月，曹操用荀攸之计，声东击西，诱使袁绍分兵西向，实则轻兵突袭白马，斩杀颜良。随后，曹操还军官渡，袁绍进保阳武。八月，袁绍不听沮授持久作战的建议，自阳武逐渐进逼至官渡。九月，曹操与袁绍交战不利，转而坚壁拒敌。最终，曹操奇袭袁军在乌巢的粮仓，击溃袁军主力。\n\n结果\n官渡之战奠定了曹操统一中国北方的基础。此战中，曹操利用奇袭和灵活的战术击败了袁绍的主力部队，展现了其卓越的军事才能和战略眼光。\n\n作战指挥中的灵活调度\n\n（一）以灵活调度为基础的作战指挥\n\n作战指挥指的是指挥官及指挥机关对所属部队作战行动的组织领导活动，其目的是统一意志，统一行动，最大限度地提高和发挥部队战斗力，夺取作战胜利。实施作战指挥，应根据上级作战意图，充分发挥主观能动性，科学分析判断情况寻求战机，合理使用兵力兵器，灵活运用战略战术，充分发挥聪明才智及指挥机关的作用，以最小的代价换取最大的胜利。因此，作战指挥最为强调灵活性，只有对所属部队在战场上实施高度灵活、准确的调度，才能支撑起所有的指挥战术。失去了灵活调度，部队就变成第一次世界大战那种呆板的阵地战，双方依托工事开展装备大战，大量有生力量白白消耗在两军阵地之间徒劳的冲锋上。\n\n灵活调度贯穿于作战指挥的全过程，涵盖各种作战情况。即使在固定的阵地战中，指挥官也应该根据战况变化灵活调度部队配属和火力配置。随着部队的减员和装备的损耗，部队应该随时做出调整，收缩阵地。莫德尔被誉为纳粹德军的防御天才，其长处就在于他不会像保卢斯那样呆板的投入兵力，而会根据战局变化、敌军战术变化和本方军队的损耗情况，合理的调整阵地、兵力和装备，始终保持严密的防守和灵活的调度。在铁原阻击战中，已经连续行军作战一个月的第63军，在减员三分之一的情况下防御铁原地区。负责阻击任务的第189师将全部兵力打散，不留预备队，以连、排为单位，像撒钉子一样撒在防线附近二十余平方公里的广阔地带，以防区内的小山丘为防御支撑点，构建工事，组成上百个防御点。这些点在分配上独立，其实又互有协同。以联军进攻的兵力，不可能同时对这上百个点展开进攻，因此，志愿军一支小部队可以防守阵前和纵深几个点，打一下换个地方，一支连队能当好几个使用。联军在拔点时一旦孤军深入，便会成为志愿军防线内的突出部，会收到来自不同方向的打击，不全部拔掉的话，联军的推进会受到身后的牵制，很是矛盾。\n\n（二）作战指挥中灵活调度的困境\n\n1、基本矛盾：诸多掣肘因素牵制消耗\n\n如前所述，灵活调度军队最基本的问题，在于各种各样的掣肘因素，牵制指挥官的命令、制约军队的行动。在计算机模拟战争游戏中，一切行动都按照既定的程序运行，一切命令都会得到彻底的执行。但是在现实生活中，太多的因素掣肘你。即使经验丰富的名将，或者精明强干的指挥团队，也会因为各种因素的牵制而无法做出有效的调度，也会做出错误的行动。\n\n1944年底盟军的市场花园行动，由于急于打通物资补给线，以及对前期作战顺利的乐观估计，一向谨慎的蒙哥马利元帅策划大胆的敌后空降作战计划，而同样习惯于以大部队稳打稳扎的艾森豪威尔将军批准了这一行动。事实证明，这一行动从一开始就受到了各方面掣肘因素的制约，从最高指挥的不切实际，到各级指挥官的盲目乐观、组织备战不力，天气、地形的不利，再加上德军部队的加强，以及虎式坦克的优势等等，都制约了该行动。在莫斯科会战前期，由于前期长达6个月的不间断进攻，以及寒冷天气和泥泞的道路，苏军高效的动员能力和将远东部队抽调西线等等，德军已经受到了诸多掣肘，兵员、装备和物资损耗巨大。德军基于现有实力，强行组织起来的莫斯科会战，实际上已经无法实现。\n\n因此，作为指挥官在调度和指挥上最根本性的错误，是不能服从实际。从理论到行动横亘着一条难以跨越的鸿沟，需要经过长期的实践去填补。而对现实存在的各种矛盾和问题的精准把握和解决，是跨越鸿沟最根本的前提。充分把握军事掣肘因素，才能充分熟悉军队和战场。对事物越熟悉，尤其是各种制约因素越熟悉，越是能够服从实际，提高实践的灵活性和准确性。\n\n2、主要矛盾：群体行动难以整合\n\n成千上万的官兵集中在战场，不可能像管理和指挥一个班那样，你可以非常熟悉每个人且在眼皮底下调度每个人，通过直接的口头命令就可让大家各司其职，哪怕有人惊慌、有人想脱离阵地，你只需要几句话或者一个动作就能镇住。但是大兵团作战，十万人乃至几十万人这样一个庞大的群体，很难有效组织起来。就是让这些部队仅仅有条的部署在各个区域，让命令有效传达从而让部队进退有序，就很不容易。此外，对整个群体的心理调动显得尤为重要，优秀的将领要能够随时熟悉战场部队的士气、心理状态等，更需要高超的群体心理调动能力。在古代战场上，一些将领通过战前迷信活动坚定士兵的必胜信息；当敌军稍微退却时，大喊敌军已经败退，提升士气；当敌军稍微混乱时，悬赏敌军首领头，从而给士兵透露出我军已经胜利的预兆。\n\n图14.18 坦能堡战役中被俘虏的沙俄第二集团军士兵\n\n如图所示，沙俄士兵被德国人称为“灰色牲口”，实际上在贵族军官们的眼里，他们就是被牲口一样对待，缺乏训练、食不果腹，连起码的行军队形都走不齐整。指挥这样的军队上战场，连起码的调度都做不到。在战役开始后，连续多日在泥泞中行军且得不到足够食物的俄军士兵，在炮火轰击后瞬间崩溃，根本无法形成建制，更谈不上作战，被同样极度疲劳的德军士兵，指点着圈起来做俘虏。\n\n3、直接矛盾：指挥官缺乏灵活调度的能力\n\n指挥官本身的能力是基本矛盾中的诸多掣肘因素之一，但作为作战指挥的直接负责人和指挥机构的领导者，诸多矛盾集中体现在指挥官身上或经过指挥官发挥，同时指挥官也是解决矛盾、防止掣肘因素的主要载体。因此，指挥官以及指挥机构的灵活调度能力，通常直接决定了军队的调度能力。\n\n二战前期，西方方面军是斯大林特殊关照的精锐部队，但在巴甫洛夫手里战斗力低下，他在开战后的数小时内下达的命令自相矛盾，让下级部队无所适从；在明斯克的战场部署四面透风，第44步兵军兵力过于稀疏，德军第三装甲集团军赫尔曼·霍特抓住漏洞很快突破苏军阵地。与巴甫洛夫的慌乱不同，接替他的叶廖缅科（西方方面军副司令，直接负责前敌指挥）算不上卓越的将领，但沉着冷静、组织能力强，至少在防御上调度有方、部署合理。虽然在斯摩棱斯克和布良斯克的战役中表现不佳，但在斯大林格勒战役中打得有声有色。\n\n如果说苏军早期的失败，是因为大清洗造成中高级将领经验不足、能力欠缺，那么德军后期指挥官能力的下降，则是希特勒的人为灾难。战争后期丧失主动权和兵力优势的情况下，德军的劣势和资源不足，本来可以通过一定程度的战役灵活性加以缓解，但是，当优秀的德军将领提出的这种要求，固执的希特勒断然加以拒绝，他不能接受任何形式的撤退。因此，希特勒以能力差强人意但意识形态正确的唯唯诺诺者替换那些能干的将领。高级军事指挥官质量的下降使德军的战役优越性成了个真正的“神话”。德军代价高昂的错误犯得越多，制造的问题就越棘手，整个战场就越被动。反过来，与战争第一阶段那些将领相比，中后期的红军指挥员及其参谋人员受过更好的教育，经验更丰富，也更具才干。苏军对自己和敌人的能力及局限性有了越来越深的了解，在此基础上进行的策划和决策，其复杂性和准确性、灵活性得到了稳步发展。比如苏军指挥官的协同指挥能力增强，尤其是表现出巨大的灵活性（例如，根据战斗侦察的结果在最后一刻调整计划，或针对变化的态势做好变更方向的准备）。尽管此时德军的战术能力依然超越苏军，但战术上取得成功的德军兵团越来越频繁地被战役级灾难吞噬。1944年夏季开始，苏军实施的“马斯基罗夫卡（一种新的战术）”通常会分散德军的注意力，而且可以隐蔽最高统帅部大本营预备队和其他预备力量的大部分部署变更，以及方面军和集团军内部从消极地带抽调各兵团组建突击集群的行动。苏军将领越来越高超的调度能力，使得大兵团作战中德军甚至无法发现苏军50%以上的力量，造成德军对苏军的严重低估。这样，苏军可以通过灵活调度在某些关键地段集中远超德军估计的力量（德军一般估计为2-3:1时，苏军实际上拥有5倍乃至8倍的战术优势）。苏军高级指挥官的调度越来越灵活，指挥越来越大胆，他们尽力隐蔽即将到来的战役的发起时间、规模、位置、方向和预期范围，直至敌人的应对已为时过晚。",

For online streaming, it captured over 65% market share on Yunhe, with daily average views exceeding 300 million per episode.\n· \"Conquest\" also achieved peak ratings when broadcast in 2003, reaching 6.2% nationally and 13% in Nanjing, maintaining significant influence to this day.\n\nRegarding critical reception:\n· \"The Knockout,\" as a recent masterpiece in the crime drama genre, received high recognition from audiences and critics. Although it didn't top some rating lists, its reputation remains solid.\n· \"Conquest\" has maintained excellent reviews since its broadcast and is considered a classic by many viewers. Its tight plot, mature acting performances, and authentic presentation earned it high praise.\n\nRegarding social impact:\n· \"The Knockout\" sparked widespread social attention, with its themes of anti-corruption and crime-fighting closely connected to real life, prompting deep reflection on social justice and rule of law.\n· \"Conquest\" also had profound social impact.

The show also depicted the struggle between police and criminal forces, promoting justice and rule of law.\n\nAfter finishing \"The Knockout\" on February 6, 2023, that long-lost feeling of being emotionally moved by a TV show finally returned. While not a perfect drama, with some logical gaps and areas for improvement, it certainly provokes deep thought and deserves to be called 2023's first masterpiece.

Your good deeds gave Gao Qiqiang opportunities to abuse power, your good deeds let Old Mo become Gao Qiqiang's assassin after release, your kindness made your loved one become someone else's wife. If you pursue justice, Master Cao Chuang would lose his reputation, the entire group's image and credibility would decline, and your justice indirectly \"killed\" Xiao Lu, caused a rift with comrade Li Xiang, sent former brothers Zhang Biao and Yang Jian to prison, and tainted the life of your respected senior Meng Dehai... As Xue Zhiqian's song \"Ambition\" lyrics say: \"I look at you, eyes unwilling to retreat. Not sure if I represent the light. In darkness we don't need pity, in justice there are questions without answers.\"\n\nI also wonder what I would choose if I were Gao Qiqiang. There were many chances to turn back, but as things developed, it became increasingly impossible until the final point of no return, when even he no longer wanted to turn back. Human nature has no absolute black and white; one thought leads to Buddha, another to demon. For twenty years, they could eat at the same table yet lament that excellence and brilliance shouldn't coexist - this is what makes them archenemies. In Gao Qiqiang's heart, he always felt grateful to An Xin, while An Xin always believed saving Gao Qiqiang's soul was more important than defeating him. The overlord Gao Qiqiang transformed from a kind and simple ordinary person. The drama draws parallels between Tianhe and Guo Shanfeng's relationship to that of Gao Qiqiang and Old Mo, but the former were more ruthless, killing women and children like Xiao Lu and Wang Li, showing lower moral boundaries. Even among the Gao brothers, Gao Qiqiang was more decent than his brother Gao Qisheng. Yet this former nice guy, who had goodness in his bones, gradually descended into crime until complete corruption, causing pain to witness. Perhaps it revealed his true nature, or perhaps human nature simply can't withstand the test of power and money.\n\nSo, here's a question worth discussing: Was An Xin's kindness and justice worth it? Was punishing Gao Qiqiang's evil necessary? The answer is that the former was absolutely worth it, and the latter absolutely necessary! What did An Xin give these people? He gave them a chance to choose again! Like Jesus in the Bible, he bore others' sins to give them another chance to choose (though this comparison isn't perfect, you should understand the meaning). Gao Qiqiang and Old Mo chose darkness, while Yang Jian and Meng Dehai chose light. Listen again to Na Ying's \"Nowhere to Hide\": \"In the crowd, clenching fists, pretending to be defiant. Against the wind, shattering the unfair walls. Scarred all over, exchanging for one hope. Let evil lies have nowhere to hide. Who can control, why should we retreat, those who should be terrified are the hypocritical facades.\" Thank you, An Xin! Thank you, An Xin! Thank you, An Xin! Unfortunately, such good people barely exist in real life.\n\nAnalyzing the plot makes little sense now as most friends have finished the series, so let's recall some classic lines:\n\nAn Xin: \"We're still young, we'll face many choices, we must choose what kind of person to be, what kind of police to be, this determines what kind of person we'll become!\"\nGao Qiqiang: \"The bigger the waves, the more valuable the fish!\"\nLi Xiang: \"Brother, you don't know what kind of abyss I've stepped into!\"\nYang Jian: \"It's hard work we do, I just ask one thing - can we do it or not!\"\nChen Shuting: \"Whoever the sister-in-law chooses becomes the big brother.\"\n\nLet's compare the major differences between the novel and TV series. Note that this is an original TV series, and the novel was adapted from the original script:\n\nIn the novel, Xu Jiang not only engaged in prostitution crimes but also organ trafficking; Huang Cuicui's body had both kidneys removed. This plot was cut from the series.\nIn the novel, when Gao Qiqiang and Xu Lei confronted each other, Xu Lei wanted to come ashore to fight, slipped in the water and was electrocuted. Gao Qiqiang pulled both up but found them dead, then pushed them back into the water. The series differs on this point.\nIn the novel, Gao Qiqiang tricked Gao Qisheng into returning; in the series, Gao Qisheng returned voluntarily to support Gao Qiqiang.\nIn the novel, Aunt Cui accepted a house from Gao Qiqiang; this was cut from the series.\nIn the novel, Meng Dehai agreed to have Meng Yu poison An Xin; this scene was cut from the series. In the novel, Meng Dehai gave Meng Yu a bank card not for Yang Jian to surrender but for the couple to flee abroad.\nThe novel states \"half of Beijing Sea's power system belongs to the Gao family, half to the Meng family.\" The series changes it to \"half belongs to the Gao family, half to the Yang family.\"\nIn the novel, An Xin speaks to Yang Jian and Ma Tao at the dock; in the series, it's Xu Zhong.\nThe novel includes a scene where An Xin and Gao Quilan are trapped in an elevator due to Guo Shanfeng's sabotage: \"Gao Quilan panicked and shouted at Guo Shanfeng outside: 'Hey out there, I'm Gao Quilan - Gao as in Gao Qiqiang, Qi as in Gao Qisheng, Lan as in Gao Quilan! If anything happens to me, my brother will tear you to pieces! I'm from the Gao family, no one in Beijing Sea dares mess with the Gao family!' An Xin looked at Gao Quilan before him, she was no longer that gentle doctor, that good girl.\" This scene was cut from the series.\nIn the novel, Huang Yao was more resolute and unmoved by Gao Qiqiang saving her; the series shows more complex emotions.\nIn the novel, Huang Yao killed Chen Shuting; in the series, it was changed to Guo Shanfeng.\n\nSummarizing the differences shows the novel seems darker than the series, with later modifications and cuts by the production team. Some changes clearly made the story more logical and character traits more prominent. For example, changing the fleeing Gao Qisheng to voluntarily return to support Gao Qiqiang reduced Gao Qiqiang's darkness, while falling with Li Xiang emphasized Gao Qisheng's ruthlessness. This series of changes and strategic adjustments better fits Gao Qisheng's character as a capable and ruthless leader.\n\nFinally, after watching the series and reading the novel, my excitement couldn't settle. On a sleepless night, two post-viewing thoughts about \"The Knockout\" flashed through my mind:\n\nAn Xin saved Gao Xiaochen with his precious Type O blood, but what kind of life will Gao Xiaochen have after Gao Qiqiang is sentenced to death and all assets are confiscated? He was a spoiled kid who only knew how to ride motorcycles and attack people while wearing hoodies and masks when Gao Qiqiang was alive. How many enemies did his two fathers and he make? So Gao Xiaochen might turn to crime for survival. Did An Xin use his precious \"panda blood\" to save another \"demon king\"?\nIn the novel, during a crisis, Gao Quilan finally reveals the Gao family's status in Beijing Sea and uses it to threaten the villain Guo Shanfeng. This shows she wasn't completely ignorant of what her brothers did, and when necessary, she too would show the Gao family's \"sharp teeth.\" After leaving Beijing Sea for Africa, would she suddenly realize: her closest brothers are gone, and the man she loved for 20 years could never be with her. Would extreme love turn to extreme hate, leading to her eventual return? Years later, would Beijing Sea again fall under Gao family control, with \"Sister Lan\" replacing \"Brother Qiang\"? Would An Xin be forced to fight again, replaying the struggle between nemeses...\n\nGao Qiqiang is like a coarsely grown aloe vera\n\nQ: If you were to compare Gao Qiqiang to a plant, what would it be?\n\nZhang Songwen: A coarsely grown aloe vera\n\nLeaves grow in clusters, large and thick\nEdges have thorny spikes\nEven without water for a month or two\nIt can still survive well\n\nHe was once society's lowest speck of dust\nParents died early, as the eldest son\nHe had to independently bear the responsibility of raising his siblings\nAnd saw them as the most important people in his life\n\nWith one bowl of pork leg noodles\nSister ate the pork, brother ate the noodles, he drank the broth\nTo care for family\nHe had no right to hospitalization when sick with fever and cold\nEvery penny was split eight ways\n\nFrom the beginning\nA meek fish vendor in the market\nTo being forced to fight thugs when desperate\nThen after tasting power\nBecoming \"Beijing Sea's overlord\"\n\nGao Qiqiang continuously absorbed\nThe leaves used for survival and storing water\nEventually turning the protective thorns\nInto weapons to harm others for ratings data, public reception, professional critics' reviews, and interviews about the antagonist actors' performance interpretations.", "checklist": [{"name": "Film Analysis Accuracy", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how accurately the response analyzes the narrative techniques and character development in both dramas, with appropriate film terminology and insights that demonstrate deep understanding of the crime drama genre.", "1-2": "Contains fundamental misunderstandings about the films or uses incorrect film terminology.

Please provide detailed lyrics, dialogue, movement requirements, and stage setup for each scene.\n\nPlease refer to The Battle of Red Cliffs refers to a major battle in the late Eastern Han Dynasty where the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei decisively defeated Cao Cao's large army in the year 208 CE (13th year of Jian'an) near Red Cliffs along the Yangtze River (in present-day northwest Chibi City, Hubei Province). This is one of China's most famous battles where the few defeated the many and the weak overcame the strong. It is the most renowned of the \"Three Major Battles\" of the Three Kingdoms period and was the largest river battle in the Yangtze River region since King Helü's defeat of Chu.\n\nCao Cao led an army of 200,000 troops downstream along the Yangtze. Sun Quan appointed Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu as left and right commanders, with Lu Su as military advisor. Zhou Yu led an elite force of 30,000 troops upstream to Xiakou, joining with Liu Bei's forces stationed at Fankou to advance westward along the Yangtze, meeting Cao's army at Red Cliffs. By this time, many of Cao's soldiers had fallen ill. After initial engagement, Cao's forces retreated and temporarily stationed at Wulin, while Zhou Yu's forces remained on the southern bank, with both armies facing each other across the river. Zhou Yu, taking advantage of Cao Cao's arrogance and underestimation, adopted his subordinate Huang Gai's suggestion to use fire attacks. They devised a plan where Huang Gai would pretend to surrender, leading ten small ships loaded with hay and oil. When the ships approached within two li of Cao's camp, they were set ablaze and, aided by the wind, crashed into Cao's fleet. This resulted in a devastating defeat for Cao's forces, with ships burned and heavy casualties extending to their camps on shore. Cao Cao ordered the burning of his remaining ships and retreated, losing half his army to hunger and disease.\n\nThe Battle of Red Cliffs, where Sun Quan and Liu Bei allied against a powerful enemy, demonstrated the effectiveness of naval warfare and clever use of fire attacks, creating a famous example in Chinese military history of the weak defeating the strong.

In 1968, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his representative works \"Snow Country,\" \"The Old Capital,\" and \"Thousand Cranes,\" becoming Asia's third Nobel Literature laureate.\n\nBorn in Osaka on June 14, 1899, he graduated from Tokyo University. He lost both parents in childhood, followed by the deaths of his sister and grandparents, earning him the nickname \"the funeral attendee.\" He traveled extensively throughout his life and struggled with melancholy, developing a sensitive and lonely personality. This inner pain and sorrow became the underlying tone of his later literary works. He wrote over 100 novels in his lifetime, mostly short and medium-length works. His writing is characterized by lyricism, pursuit of life's sublime beauty, and influences from Buddhism and nihilism. Kawabata was skilled at using stream of consciousness to reveal characters' inner worlds. He gained fame with \"The Izu Dancer.\"\n\nKawabata received numerous prestigious awards including the Kikuchi Prize (1944), Japan Art Academy Prize (1952), Noma Literary Prize (1954), and Mainichi Publishing Culture Prize (1961). In 1953, he was elected to the Japan Art Academy, the highest honor in Japanese literature and arts. In 1961, the Japanese government awarded him the Order of Culture for \"creating unprecedented works depicting Japanese beauty with unique style and deep emotion.\" He received the Goethe Medal from West Germany in 1957 and the Order of Arts and Letters from France in 1960.\n\nOn April 16, 1972, Kawabata took his own life by gas inhalation, leaving no written suicide note. He had said in 1962, \"Suicide without a note is best. A wordless death is infinite life.\"\n\nLiterary Schools and Important Writers\nPre-war Japanese literature included proletarian literature, modernist literature, and national policy literature. Proletarian literature focused on working-class life and struggles, represented by Takiji Kobayashi's \"The Crab Cannery Ship,\" which revealed class conflicts. Modernist literature emphasized personal inner experiences and formal innovation, represented by writers like Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima. National policy literature promoted state policies during wartime, exemplified by works like Ashihei Hino's \"Wheat and Soldiers.\"\n\n\"Yugen\" (profound mystery) centers on \"residual emotion,\" emphasizing implications beyond words and pursuing refined beauty that stimulates imagination and conveys rich emotional content. Scholar Katsumi Onishi analyzed \"yugen\" as having seven aspects:\n1. Hidden, internal meaning\n2. Gentle beauty opposed to direct expression\n3. Quiet accompanied by subtle shadows\n4. Spiritual depth\n5. Rich inner meaning\n6. Mystical and supernatural qualities\n7. Subtle, ineffable qualities\n\nOverall, \"yugen\" represents mysterious beauty connected to Buddhist thought, manifesting in literature as either ethereal beauty within desolation or a degree of sublime beauty.", "checklist": [{"name": "Script Structure Adherence", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response follows the required script format with opening introduction, main analysis, concluding summary, visual content indicators, narration cues, and marked music/transitions.", "1-2": "Script lacks basic structural elements with no clear sections, missing most or all format requirements (introductions, visual cues, transitions, etc.), making it unusable as a video script.", "3-4": "Script has rudimentary structure but fails to consistently mark visual content, narration, music, or transitions;

Created the \"Five-dimensional Space Mathematics\" method (able to see through and change exam questions), helping students quickly identify examiners' intentions. Hopes to inject the world's most elegant methods into students' minds through dual-teacher classroom.\n\nMathematical Olympiad teaching methods mainly include:\n1. Knowledge summary: First, carefully review and summarize textbook knowledge points, including formulas and theorems from each chapter. It's recommended to write key formulas and theorems in a small notebook for easy reference.\n2. Logical thinking development: Mathematical Olympiad emphasizes developing students' logical thinking abilities. In daily study, practice reasoning and thinking exercises, such as logic games and mathematical puzzles, to train flexibility and agility of thinking.\n3. Reading comprehension techniques: Olympiad reading comprehension questions require students to solve problems under given conditions. The technique is to first read through the problem, understand the background and requirements, then analyze step by step, extract key information, and finally reason and solve.\n4. Creativity cultivation: Application and innovation problems in Mathematical Olympiad are important for developing students' creativity. Try setting up mathematical games and challenges to cultivate innovative thinking in solving practical problems.\n\nMathematical Olympiad teaching features include:\n1. Focus on thinking training: Emphasizes training thinking abilities rather than simple knowledge infusion. Students need to learn through active exploration and questioning rather than passive acceptance.\n2. Hands-brain combination: Requires concrete objects to assist in understanding abstract concepts, developing abstract thinking through hands-on operation.\n3. Progressive learning: Requires step-by-step progress, avoiding rushing for quick results. Parents and teachers need to guide patiently, gradually increase difficulty, and avoid students losing interest due to excessive difficulty.\n4.

The article should be written in a formal academic style suitable for business management reports, targeting corporate managers, risk management practitioners, and MBA students. It is recommended to choose an influential real case (such as a multinational company's failure in supply chain management, financial management, data security, or public relations crisis management), and describe in detail the background of the incident, company response measures, key deficiencies in the risk management process, and subsequent impacts of the failure.

The SEC investigation revealed that Enron had concealed $500 million in debt through off-balance-sheet (investment partnership) arrangements and had falsified $580 million in profits since 1997.\n\nMeanwhile, Enron's stock price plummeted from $80 at the beginning of 2001 to 80 cents. In December of the same year, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection, but in the previous 10 months, the company had paid $320 million in bonuses to directors and senior executives because the stock price exceeded target expectations.\n\nAfter the Enron incident, analysis revealed that Enron's board of directors and audit committee adopted a \"hands-off\" monitoring approach, failing to effectively oversee management, including not questioning their innovative accounting methods using \"investment partnerships.\" After the incident, some directors admitted they didn't fully understand Enron's financial situation or their futures and options business.\n\nDue to Enron's emphasis on short-term performance metrics and management compensation being linked to stock performance, management was incentivized to use innovative accounting methods and falsification to earn substantial bonuses. Although Enron employed sophisticated risk quantification methods to monitor futures risk, operational risk internal controls were essentially non-existent, with senior management often ignoring or overriding established internal control systems. This was a crucial factor leading to Enron's ultimate collapse.\n\n\"Risk Management Practices\"\nThis book, written by experts in risk management, comprehensively introduces basic concepts, methods, and tools of risk management.

党的十八大以来，习近平总书记高度重视全面依法治国，亲自谋划、亲自部署、亲自推动。在这一过程中，习近平总书记创造性提出了关于全面依法治国的一系列新理念新思想新战略，形成了内涵丰富、科学系统的思想体系，为建设法治中国指明了前进方向，在中国特色社会主义法治建设进程中具有重大政治意义、理论意义、实践意义。习近平法治思想从历史和现实相贯通、国际和国内相关联、理论和实际相结合上深刻回答了新时代为什么实行全面依法治国、怎样实行全面依法治国等一系列重大问题，是顺应实现中华民族伟大复兴时代要求应运而生的重大理论创新成果，是马克思主义法治理论中国化最新成果，是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的重要组成部分，是全面依法治国的根本遵循和行动指南。党的十八大以来，我国社会主义法治建设发生历史性变革、取得历史性成就，全面依法治国实践取得重大进展，根本在于有习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想特别是习近平法治思想的科学指引。\n   习近平法治思想内涵丰富、论述深刻、逻辑严密、系统完备。就其主要方面来讲，就是习近平总书记在这次会议重要讲话中精辟概括的“十一个坚持”：坚持党对全面依法治国的领导；坚持以人民为中心；坚持中国特色社会主义法治道路；坚持依宪治国、依宪执政；坚持在法治轨道上推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化；坚持建设中国特色社会主义法治体系；坚持依法治国、依法执政、依法行政共同推进，法治国家、法治政府、法治社会一体建设；坚持全面推进科学立法、严格执法、公正司法、全民守法；坚持统筹推进国内法治和涉外法治；坚持建设德才兼备的高素质法治工作队伍；坚持抓住领导干部这个“关键少数”。这“十一个坚持”，既是重大工作部署，又是重大战略思想，我们必须深入学习领会，抓好贯彻落实。\n   一切伟大的实践，都需要科学理论的正确指引。全党全国要把认真学习领会习近平法治思想作为当前和今后一个时期的一项重大政治任务，吃透基本精神、把握核心要义、明确工作要求，牢牢把握全面依法治国政治方向、重要地位、工作布局、重点任务、重大关系、重要保障，坚持习近平法治思想在全面依法治国中的指导地位，把习近平法治思想贯彻落实到全面依法治国各方面和全过程，更好转化为全面建设社会主义法治国家的生动实践。让我们更加紧密地团结在以习近平同志为核心的党中央周围，增强“四个意识”、坚定“四个自信”、做到“两个维护”，坚持习近平法治思想，深入推进全面依法治国，不断开创新时代法治中国建设新局面，为全面建设社会主义现代化国家、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而不懈奋斗。\n   新华社北京1月8日电（记者杨维汉）中央政法工作会议7日至8日在北京召开。中共中央总书记、国家主席、中央军委主席习近平出席会议并发表重要讲话。他强调，要把维护社会大局稳定作为基本任务，把促进社会公平正义作为核心价值追求，把保障人民安居乐业作为根本目标，坚持严格执法公正司法，积极深化改革，加强和改进政法工作，维护人民群众切身利益，为实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦提供有力保障。\n\n    中共中央政治局常委、中央书记处书记刘云山，中共中央政治局常委、国务院副总理张高丽出席会议。\n\n    习近平在讲话中强调，政法战线要旗帜鲜明坚持党的领导。坚持党的领导，就是要支持人民当家作主，实施好依法治国这个党领导人民治理国家的基本方略。既要坚持党对政法工作的领导不动摇，又要加强和改善党对政法工作的领导，不断提高党领导政法工作能力和水平。\n\n    习近平指出，要正确处理党的政策和国家法律的关系。我们党的政策和国家法律都是人民根本意志的反映，在本质上是一致的。党既领导人民制定宪法法律，也领导人民执行宪法法律，做到党领导立法、保证执法、带头守法。政法工作要自觉维护党的政策和国家法律的权威性，确保党的政策和国家法律得到统一正确实施。要正确处理坚持党的领导和确保司法机关依法独立公正行使职权的关系。各级党组织和领导干部要支持政法系统各单位依照宪法法律独立负责、协调一致开展工作。党委政法委要明确职能定位，善于运用法治思维和法治方式领导政法工作，在推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化中发挥重要作用。\n\n    习近平强调，维护社会大局稳定是政法工作的基本任务。要处理好维稳和维权的关系，要把群众合理合法的利益诉求解决好，完善对维护群众切身利益具有重大作用的制度，强化法律在化解矛盾中的权威地位，使群众由衷感到权益受到了公平对待、利益得到了有效维护。要处理好活力和秩序的关系，坚持系统治理、依法治理、综合治理、源头治理，发动全社会一起来做好维护社会稳定工作。\n\n    习近平指出，促进社会公平正义是政法工作的核心价值追求。从一定意义上说，公平正义是政法工作的生命线，司法机关是维护社会公平正义的最后一道防线。政法战线要肩扛公正天平、手持正义之剑，以实际行动维护社会公平正义，让人民群众切实感受到公平正义就在身边。要重点解决好损害群众权益的突出问题，决不允许对群众的报警求助置之不理，决不允许让普通群众打不起官司，决不允许滥用权力侵犯群众合法权益，决不允许执法犯法造成冤假错案。\n\n    习近平强调，保障人民安居乐业是政法工作的根本目标。政法机关和广大干警要把人民群众的事当作自己的事，把人民群众的小事当作自己的大事，从让人民群众满意的事情做起，从人民群众不满意的问题改起，为人民群众安居乐业提供有力法律保障。要深入推进社会治安综合治理，坚决遏制严重刑事犯罪高发态势，保障人民生命财产安全。\n\n    习近平指出，政法机关要完成党和人民赋予的光荣使命，必须严格执法、公正司法。“公生明，廉生威。”要坚守职业良知、执法为民，教育引导广大干警自觉用职业道德约束自己，做到对群众深恶痛绝的事零容忍、对群众急需急盼的事零懈怠，树立惩恶扬善、执法如山的浩然正气。要信仰法治、坚守法治，做知法、懂法、守法、护法的执法者，站稳脚跟，挺直脊梁，只服从事实，只服从法律，铁面无私，秉公执法。要靠制度来保障，在执法办案各个环节都设置隔离墙、通上高压线，谁违反制度就要给予最严厉的处罚，构成犯罪的要依法追究刑事责任。要坚持以公开促公正、以透明保廉洁，增强主动公开、主动接受监督的意识，让暗箱操作没有空间，让司法腐败无法藏身。\n\n    习近平强调，各级领导干部要带头依法办事，带头遵守法律，牢固确立法律红线不能触碰、法律底线不能逾越的观念，不要去行使依法不该由自己行使的权力，更不能以言代法、以权压法、徇私枉法。要建立健全违反法定程序干预司法的登记备案通报制度和责任追究制度。\n\n    习近平强调，我们的政法队伍主流是好的，是一支听党指挥、服务人民、能打硬仗、不怕牺牲的队伍，是一支党和人民完全可以信赖的有坚强战斗力的队伍。各级党委和政府要认真落实从优待警的政策措施，帮助干警解决实际困难。要按照政治过硬、业务过硬、责任过硬、纪律过硬、作风过硬的要求，努力建设一支信念坚定、执法为民、敢于担当、清正廉洁的政法队伍。\n\n    习近平指出，坚定的理想信念是政法队伍的政治灵魂。必须把理想信念教育摆在政法队伍建设第一位，不断打牢高举旗帜、听党指挥、忠诚使命的思想基础，坚持党的事业至上、人民利益至上、宪法法律至上，永葆忠于党、忠于国家、忠于人民、忠于法律的政治本色。政法队伍要敢于担当，面对歪风邪气，必须敢于亮剑、坚决斗争，绝不能听之任之；面对急难险重任务，必须豁得出来、顶得上去，绝不能畏缩不前。要加强纪律教育，健全纪律执行机制，以铁的纪律带出一支铁的政法队伍。要提高干警本领，确保更好履行政法工作各项任务。要以最坚决的意志、最坚决的行动扫除政法领域的腐败现象，坚决清除害群之马。\n\n    习近平强调，司法体制改革是政治体制改革的重要组成部分，对推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化具有十分重要的意义。要加强领导、协力推动、务求实效，加快建设公正高效权威的社会主义司法制度，更好坚持党的领导、更好发挥我国司法制度的特色、更好促进社会公平正义。\n\n    中共中央政治局委员、中央政法委书记孟建柱就做好2014年政法工作作出部署。他要求，要认真贯彻党的十八大和十八届二中、三中全会精神及各项工作部署，全面贯彻落实习近平总书记系列重要讲话精神，围绕完善和发展中国特色社会主义制度、推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化总目标，把握促进社会公平正义、增进人民福祉的总要求，坚持稳中求进、改革创新，以创新社会治理方式、深化司法体制改革、推进科技信息应用、改进政法宣传舆论工作为着力点，深入推进平安中国、法治中国和过硬队伍建设，切实提高政法工作现代化水平。\n\n    部分中共中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记、国务委员，最高人民法院院长、最高人民检察院检察长出席会议。\n\n    中央政法委、中央政法各单位负责人，各省区市和新疆生产建设兵团党委政法委、政法各单位负责人，中央和国家机关及军队、武警部队负责人参加会议。", "checklist": [{"name": "思想汇报格式规范性", "criteria_description":

{"index": 755, "domain1": "Education", "domain2": "Evaluation Comments", "query": "Write a brief comment on first-grade students' math performance, highlighting their progress in basic calculations. The comment should be of substantial length (recommended minimum 50 words), emphasizing specific improvements or notable events during the learning process, such as actively raising hands to answer questions in class or accurately completing certain types of problems in assignments.\nPlease refer to the student's specific learning record: 1. Study Plan Development\nDuring interviews with Xiaoming and his parents, I learned that Xiaoming's current academic performance is average. His parents have certain expectations for his academic achievement and hope he can stand out in class. After further understanding Xiaoming's learning interests and goals, I developed a reasonable study plan with him.\nXiaoming's goal is to make progress in the three main subjects: Chinese, Mathematics, and English, and achieve good results. Based on his learning situation and goals, I developed a weekly study plan, including key content and review arrangements for each subject. I also suggested that Xiaoming maintain consistency in his studies by previewing and reviewing daily.\n\n2. Learning Method Guidance\nDuring the process of guiding Xiaoming's learning methods, I noticed that his understanding of study methods was rather superficial, often relying on rote memorization without knowing how to apply the knowledge learned. Therefore, I introduced him to some common learning methods, such as induction, association, and explanation methods, and provided practical demonstrations.\nFor Chinese learning, I taught Xiaoming how to comprehend articles, including understanding key vocabulary, analyzing sentence structure and logical relationships, and extracting the main ideas. For Mathematics, I taught him problem-solving techniques such as organizing thoughts, step-by-step analysis, and drawing inferences. For English, I encouraged him to listen, read, speak, and write more to develop his language sense and expression abilities.\n\n3. Study Habit Development\nXiaoming had some poor study habits, such as procrastination, laziness, and lack of concentration. I provided solutions for these issues and implemented corresponding training and corrections.\nFirst, I suggested Xiaoming create a study schedule that specified daily study times and tasks. By consciously following the schedule, he could effectively manage time and reduce procrastination and laziness.\nSecond, I encouraged Xiaoming to cultivate a good study environment, including a quiet study space, clean desk, and comfortable chair. This helps him concentrate and improve study efficiency.\nAdditionally, I suggested Xiaoming engage in daily exercise and rest to maintain good health and energy for better focus on studies.\n\n4. Learning Progress\nOver several months of tutoring, Xiaoming's learning attitude has changed significantly. His learning enthusiasm has increased, and his interest in studying has gradually grown. During weekly tutoring sessions, he could complete preview and review tasks well and actively sought my help with knowledge-related questions.\nIn Chinese, Xiaoming's reading comprehension has improved, and he can better understand articles, grasping their main ideas and key points. In Mathematics, his problem-solving techniques and thinking abilities have improved, enabling him to independently solve more complex problems. In English, Xiaoming's listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills have notably improved, allowing him to engage in basic communication and expression.", "checklist": [{"name": "Relevance to Student Math Performance", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response addresses the first-grade students' math performance specifically, focusing on basic calculations as requested in the query.", "1-2": "Response completely fails to address first-grade math performance or basic calculations, instead discussing unrelated subjects, grade levels, or content from the learning record without adaptation.", "3-4": "Response mentions math but doesn't focus on first-grade level or basic calculations;

The article should explain the impact of each milestone experiment on overall scientific development, while addressing technical challenges and their solutions. The article should include specific technical details (such as experimental apparatus principles, design, and improvements), as well as scientists' backgrounds and their influence in scientific history. The article length should be no less than 4,000 words, with appropriate use of charts or data to help explain complex concepts. If possible, include the author's own research experience or insights in related fields to add personal depth and unique perspectives. The final product should target readers with basic scientific background, aiming to balance scientific accuracy, depth, and readability. For detailed technical information and case studies on Bose-Einstein condensation experiments and quantum computer working principles and construction processes, refer to: Quantum Computer Principles and Application Case Analysis\n\nQuantum computers are computers based on quantum mechanical principles that use quantum bits (qubits) for computation. Unlike classical bits used in traditional computers, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This property beyond classical computers gives quantum computers more powerful computing capabilities and broader application scenarios.\n\nI. Quantum Computer Principles\n1. Quantum Bits: Qubits are the basic units of quantum computers. Unlike the 0s and 1s of classical computers, they can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1 states, and can be correlated with other qubits through entanglement. Entanglement is a key concept in quantum computing, enabling information transfer and interaction between qubits.\n2. Quantum Gates: These are basic operational units for manipulating qubits, enabling bit transformation and interaction. Quantum gate operations are completed through superposition and entanglement states of qubits, facilitating conversion and information transfer between qubits.\n3. Quantum State Measurement: Final results in quantum computers are obtained by measuring quantum states of qubits. In quantum computers, measurement results are affected by superposition and entanglement states of qubits, leading to uncertainty and statistical nature of results. Quantum computer design and algorithms need to consider how to effectively utilize quantum state measurement characteristics to obtain correct computational results.\n\nII. Quantum Computer Application Case Analysis\n1. Quantum Simulation: Quantum computers can simulate and study quantum mechanical systems, which is very difficult or impossible on traditional computers. Quantum simulation can be used to study quantum materials, biomolecules, and other fields, helping scientists understand their properties and behaviors.\n2. Optimization Problems: In many practical problems, finding global optimal solutions is very difficult and requires substantial computational resources and time. Quantum computers can solve some optimization problems through quantum algorithms (such as quantum annealing and quantum variational eigenvalue optimization algorithms), providing more efficient solutions. This has wide applications in logistics planning, investment portfolio optimization, and other fields.\n3. Encryption and Code Breaking: The emergence of quantum computers poses huge challenges to existing encryption algorithms and cryptographic systems. Quantum computers have powerful parallel computing and processing speeds that can break currently considered secure encryption algorithms. Therefore, quantum computer applications in code breaking and secure communications may change the existing encryption landscape.\n4. Machine Learning: Machine learning is a field relying on extensive computational resources, and quantum computers can provide more efficient computational methods for some machine learning problems. For example, quantum machine learning algorithms can provide faster solutions in pattern recognition, classification, and clustering problems. Additionally, quantum random walk algorithms and quantum support vector machine algorithms bring innovation to the machine learning field.\n5. Chemical Simulation: Quantum computers can simulate and study quantum mechanical behaviors of complex molecular systems, used for optimizing catalyst design, drug development, and other fields. Through quantum computing capabilities, processes like molecular structure optimization and reaction dynamics simulation can be accelerated, providing more effective tools for chemical research.\n\nSummary:\nQuantum computers are computers based on quantum mechanical principles using qubits for computation. They have more powerful computing capabilities and broader application scenarios than traditional computers. Quantum computer principles include quantum bits, quantum gates, and quantum state measurement, while applications include quantum simulation, optimization problems, encryption and code breaking, machine learning, and chemical simulation. With further development of quantum computer technology, it is believed they will bring innovation and breakthroughs in more fields.\n\n[Note: The rest of the Chinese text appears to be about Einstein-Bose condensation experiments, which is a different topic from the quantum computing section I translated.

Finally, the presentation includes moderate projections of future trends.\n\nRegarding case studies of quantum computing applications in engineering optimization, particularly in practical fields such as supply chain optimization, scheduling problems, or traffic flow optimization, reference materials include: Research Content on Quantum Computing Applications in Supply Chain Optimization:\n\nBasic Framework of Quantum Supply Chain\n01. System Architecture of Quantum Supply Chain\nComposed of quantum computing components and classical computing components, where quantum components handle quantum information and classical components process classical information.\n\n02. Supply Chain Coordination Based on Quantum Entanglement\nAchieving tight coordination and cooperation between supply chain links through quantum entanglement properties.\n\n03. Optimization Objectives of Quantum Supply Chain\nOptimizing supply chain using quantum algorithms to minimize costs, improve efficiency, and increase profits.\n\nQuantum Supply Chain Optimization Algorithms:\n- Quantum Genetic Algorithm: Combines advantages of quantum computing and genetic algorithms\n- Quantum Ant Colony Algorithm: Enhances ant colony algorithm performance using quantum computing capabilities\n- Quantum Simulated Annealing Algorithm: Seeks global optimal solutions through simulating physical annealing processes\n\nResearch Content on Quantum Computing Applications in Scheduling:\nTraditional resource scheduling solutions are based on classical optimization techniques, reducing scheduling problems to known mathematical models. However, as resource scheduling is an NP-hard problem, these methods become limited due to computational complexity when solution space rapidly expands. Intelligent algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA) are increasingly applied. Cloud computing has lowered resource entry barriers and created massive resource pools, increasing scheduling complexity. Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) is widely used due to its probabilistic optimization and broad search space characteristics. This paper proposes an improved QGA with real-number encoding, using rotation gates for updates and mutation operators to avoid local optima.\n\n1. Cloud Resource Scheduling Model\n1.1 Scheduling Model\nCloud computing resource scheduling can be described by a quaternion of n users and m resources. Results show IQGA is more efficient than GA and PSO in solving cloud resource scheduling problems, significantly reducing cloud service provider costs.\n\nResearch Content on Quantum Computing Applications in Traffic Flow Optimization:\nQuantum computing, based on quantum mechanics principles, shows superior capabilities in traffic flow prediction, route optimization, and intelligent signal control. It can process large-scale traffic data and complex nonlinear relationships for more accurate real-time predictions using quantum neural networks. In route optimization, quantum computing can quickly process numerous route possibilities using quantum annealing algorithms. For intelligent signal control, quantum computing enables dynamic adjustment of signal timing through real-time traffic flow analysis and quantum reinforcement learning algorithms.\n\nChallenges include hardware limitations, interdisciplinary integration requirements, and data security concerns.

{"index": 847, "domain1": "Politics & Law", "domain2": "Government Speech", "query": "Please prepare a government speech for the upcoming symposium on public policy and judicial transparency, focusing on 'enhancing judicial credibility.' The speech should cover the following aspects: First, highlight the government's significant progress in promoting judicial reform and transparency, including measures such as publishing court decisions, optimizing trial procedures, and strengthening public supervision. Second, present successful cases of addressing judicial efficiency and fairness through policy innovation and technology applications (such as e-governance and big data analytics). Third, outline specific plans for future promotion of judicial transparency and credibility building, including improving supervision mechanisms, strengthening cooperation among judicial departments, and increasing judicial protection for vulnerable groups. Fourth, call for joint efforts from all sectors to uphold the spirit of rule of law and social justice. Additionally, please ensure that policy details are expressed in language that the public can understand, avoiding overly technical terms or obscure expressions to enhance communication effectiveness. The speech should not exceed 1,800 words, maintain a clear logical structure, and convey a positive and practical emotional tone. Specific examples of government judicial reform and transparency can refer to: Government Cases in Judicial Reform:\n\nCase 1: \"Sunshine Trial\" for Small Claims\nIn a small county, Old Zhang was owed several thousand yuan by his neighbor, Old Li. Previously, such small cases would drag on, making Old Zhang worry whether he could recover his money. With judicial reform, small claims courts implemented \"sunshine trials.\" The entire trial process became transparent, and from filing to verdict, it moved as fast as a rocket. The judge simplified procedures and focused on key points. Old Zhang successfully recovered his money and told everyone: \"This judicial reform is truly a blessing for us common people, like creating a fast track for small cases.\" This case shows how small claims reform can help ordinary people experience efficient and fair justice even in minor disputes.\n\nCase 2: Complex Economic Dispute Under the \"Judge Quota System\"\nA large enterprise had a complex economic dispute with several small suppliers, involving multiple contract terms and financial accounts. Previously, judges of varying competence might have handled such cases, leading to unreliable results. However, under the \"judge quota system,\" the judge handling this case was an elite selected through rigorous screening. Using rich professional knowledge and experience, the judge meticulously unraveled the complex relationships and delivered a verdict that satisfied all parties. This demonstrates how the \"quota system\" places more capable judges in key positions, greatly improving the quality of complex case adjudication.\n\nTransparency-Related Specific Cases:\n\nI. Building an Integrated Policy Database System to Promote Systematic Policy Integration\n\nThrough policy data collection, standardized processing, and external policy display and push services, the system achieves centralized collection and standardized processing of multi-level government policy documents. For policy access scenarios, it provides precise policy queries, intelligent matching, hot topics, categorical display, intelligent correlation, and personalized subscription services. Additionally, it enables accurate delivery of policies and supporting interpretations, services, and interactions based on public and enterprise needs, achieving a \"policy finds people\" effect. Through \"precise\" policy queries, \"diverse\" policy interpretations, and \"systematic\" policy maps, it achieves systematic policy integration, improves policy data quality, reduces human input in policy implementation, and effectively enhances government efficiency.\n\n1. \"Precise\" Policy Queries\nPingxiang City leverages data's fundamental resource role and innovation engine function to build a digital economy with data as a key element, using big data to enhance government transparency. The city government portal's homepage provides a policy document library section, categorizing policies \"horizontally\" into personal and enterprise sections, while \"vertically\" categorizing them by service object, lifecycle, policy theme, policy level, and publication year, building a scientific policy document classification system. It provides policy search, consultation, and subscription functions, truly making policies \"findable, understandable, and usable.\"\n\n2. \"Diverse\" Policy Interpretations\nThe Pingxiang government website extends key work from policy release to policy interpretation. To make content \"accessible and understandable\" to the public, it innovates through various methods, using websites and government new media to publish text interpretations, long image interpretations, video interpretations, digital human interpretations, press conferences, precise policy delivery, and leadership interpretations. It has published 667 various forms of policy interpretations, achieving 100% interpretation rate for key policy documents and 100% policy interpretation correlation rate, making policy documents \"findable, understandable, and usable.\"\n\n3. \"Systematic\" Policy Maps\nFocusing on hot-topic policy documents, policy maps are built on policy detail pages, using visualized graphics to aggregate policy interpretations, related services, and common questions, helping users efficiently and precisely grasp policies and related information, clearing implementation blockages. Policy maps help users better understand the overall policy architecture and relationships between policies, interpretations, services, common questions, and related documents, presenting policy data systematically and flat, allowing users to clearly grasp policy origins, implementation, development, and feedback.\n\nII. Comprehensively Advancing Grassroots Government Transparency, Opening Up the \"Full Process\"\n\n1. \"Full Process\" Data Reporting\nThrough an integrated government transparency platform, Pingxiang City provides grassroots government transparency standard management, grassroots unit public information reporting, grassroots government transparency data aggregation, grassroots government transparency information release, and grassroots government transparency columns, supporting \"full process\" online data reporting, review, release, and assessment services, covering the entire administrative power operation process and government service process at the grassroots level, helping achieve standardized, regulated, and automated grassroots government transparency.\n\n2. \"Full Disclosure\" in Key Areas\nIn advancing standardized and regulated grassroots government transparency, Pingxiang City actively participates in building standardized and regulated counties (districts) and townships (streets), fully utilizing government portals and information disclosure platforms to centrally disclose information about major construction projects, public resource transactions, compulsory education, household registration management, social assistance, elderly care services, etc. Currently, 26 areas of government transparency content are published through grassroots government transparency topics, aggregating 28,967 pieces of grassroots government transparency information, addressing issues such as arbitrariness in grassroots government transparency, low-quality disclosure content, non-unified platforms, inadequate interpretation and response, and non-transparent services.\n\nIII. Aggregating Multiple New Media Platforms for \"Multi-Channel\" Government Voice Communication\n\nPingxiang City incorporates all registered government new media accounts into a matrix system, centrally displaying QR codes for government new media accounts from 35 government departments and 6 counties/districts (including development zones), opening information transmission channels between various levels and departments, expanding government information radiation scope, achieving citywide government new media integration.\n\nLeveraging new media's advantages of fast transmission, wide coverage, and convenient use, it forms an overall linked, synchronous policy information communication pattern, effectively expanding government communication reach, further enhancing policy communication effectiveness, smoothing interactive response channels, exerting \"government power at fingertips,\" creating a \"fingertip online government\" satisfying people and recognized by society.\n\n1. \"Scientific and Effective\" Matrix Classification\nAggregates 42 WeChat public accounts, 21 Weibo accounts, 1 Toutiao account, and 2 Douyin accounts according to new media distribution, scenario classification, department classification, and district/county classification.\n\n2. \"One-Touch\" Hot Topics\nSets up \"micro-topics\" and \"hot articles\" sections, aggregating current hot topics and articles displayed on the government new media matrix homepage, connecting various new media platforms, displaying article titles, news images, new media account names, reading and like counts, achieving \"one-touch hot topics, at-a-glance important news.\"\n\n3. \"Comprehensive\" Data Statistics\nProvides intuitive data statistics for Pingxiang City's government new media matrix operation, including WeChat rankings, Weibo rankings, and new media release trends by time dimension, achieving comprehensive data statistics.\n\nIV. Comprehensive Data Integration Analysis Supporting \"Evidence-Based\" Decision-Making\n\nWith the mission of \"hearing people's voices, observing people's conditions, solving people's worries, and benefiting people's lives,\" Pingxiang City conducts deep analysis and mining of government transparency data, information disclosure data, government-public interaction data, public sentiment data, and government voice transmission data through unified website operation data access, and builds an integrated supervision service system. This promotes government service transformation from function-driven to demand-driven, governance mode from planned management to precise governance, and decision-making methods from experience-based to data-driven intelligent judgment. Using big data technology for deep analysis and mining of various data, it constructs an intuitive dynamic big data analysis landscape, providing decision-making basis for leaders in government transparency.\n\nThe integrated supervision service system provides government transparency data overview, information disclosure big data analysis, government-public interaction big data analysis, key area supervision analysis, major project supervision analysis, public sentiment data analysis, government voice transmission analysis, integrated supervision dashboard, content update early warning monitoring, monitoring report intelligent distribution, etc., fundamentally solving management's inability to grasp website operation and public information access issues. Through big data analysis of government information disclosure guarantee, it clearly shows website information update delays, key area column information disclosure, information guarantee by county/district, government website information overview, interactive platform handling, and government information disclosure guarantee, creating an online data analysis zone for effective integration of government transparency and data.", "checklist": [{"name": "Speech Structure and Content Comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the speech addresses all required sections (judicial reform progress, successful cases, future plans, call for joint efforts) and maintains the requested logical structure while adhering to the word limit of 1,800 words.", "1-2": "Severely incomplete speech that omits multiple required sections, lacks any coherent structure, and either grossly exceeds or falls far short of the word limit.

They married on May 20, 2021, and had a daughter. He Zhongyang also had a son from his previous marriage and operated an advertising company and a construction company. Before marrying Xie Yumei, He Zhongyang had been previously married. After their marriage, Xie discovered her husband's divorce judgment from his previous marriage, which revealed: \"After marriage, due to the defendant's violent temper and failure to fulfill husbandly duties, he frequently verbally abused and physically assaulted the plaintiff, making cohabitation impossible and resulting in irreparable marriage.\"\n\nAccording to Xie Yumei, during their marriage, He Zhongyang frequently subjected her to verbal abuse, threats, and physical violence, totaling 16 incidents over two years. The first instance of domestic violence occurred less than two months after marriage, just a week after she discovered her pregnancy, resulting in multiple injuries. During this period, she sought medical treatment, reported to police multiple times, and sought help from various departments to escape the marriage, but without success. For self-protection, she changed her phone number and fled to other places or friends' homes, reported to police six times, sought help from Women's Federation, community services, civil affairs department, called the 12345 hotline, and applied for a personal protection order. Police issued domestic violence warning letters to He Zhongyang twice, but he refused to change. Her lawyer advised that divorce litigation would be time-consuming and suggested negotiated divorce. Though she attempted to escape, she was always found. Xie and He signed divorce papers on April 15, 2023, but they remain legally married. Their daughter, under two years old, is being raised by He's family.\n\nKey Participants:\nVictim: Xie Yumei\nDefendant: He Zhongyang\nVictim's Attorney: Yao Kefeng\n\nKey Controversies:\n1. Frequency of Violence and Injury Assessment: The court confirmed 16 instances of domestic violence, including beatings, striking with knife handles, and hot liquid attacks.\n\n2. Legal Application and Sentencing: While He was sentenced to 11 years in prison, debates continue about whether this sentence is sufficient to deter potential abusers and protect victims.\n\n3. Evidence Collection and Legal Implementation: Evidence collection is crucial but challenging as domestic violence typically occurs in private spaces with sudden onset.\n\n4.

改革开放以来，随着西方文化思潮的大量涌入和我国社会主义市场经济的不断发展，社会各界对“什么是优秀文艺作品、创作什么样的优秀文艺作品”众说纷纭、争论不休、见仁见智，存在着许多不同甚至相互抵牾的回答：有人从作品的思想内容出发，认为接地气、反映群众真实生活的作品是好作品；有人认为文艺作品是纯形式的，评判文艺作品毋须顾及作品的内涵和内容；有人从读者接受层面对文艺作品予以评判，认为能够引起强烈共鸣的作品就是优秀作品；有人从商业化角度出发，认为衡量文艺作品应着眼于市场回报；更有甚者则认为衡量文艺作品并没有客观标准，可以随意率性为之。由于评判标准的差异、冲突，一些人在文艺为什么人的问题上发生了理解偏差，甚至为一己之私，对原始展示丑恶和低俗本能的作品津津乐道，对颠倒是非、混淆黑白、损污英雄的错误倾向置若罔闻乃至推波助澜；也有一些人在市场经济大潮中迷失了方向，屈从于商业、金钱、权力、美色，以致人情批评、面子批评、红包批评等极为恶劣的情况在文艺界恣行。究竟什么样的文艺作品才是优秀文艺作品？纵观全部人类艺术史，的确没有绝对一致的标准，但艺术精品又总是呈现出健康和进步的态势，符合社会发展的整体趋势和大多数民众的精神文化需求，衡量文艺作品的好坏优劣，应当有一套相对客观、合理的标准，这符合艺术发展的规律，也是人们获得认知世界统一性的体现。无论是从诸如“思无邪”、①“文质彬彬”、②“发乎情，止乎礼义”③等古代品评中发展出的文艺评判准则，还是恩格斯提出的“美学观点与历史观点”这一最高的标准，还是改革开放以来形成的诸如“思想性”、“审美性”、“娱乐性”等不同标准，都是为寻求特定历史时期相对客观合理的文艺作品评判标准所作出的尝试。在2014年10月15日召开的文艺工作座谈会上，习近平提出“精品之所以‘精’，就在于其思想精深、艺术精湛、制作精良”；④在党的十九大报告中，习近平再次强调要坚持“思想精深、艺术精湛、制作精良相统一”，⑤不断推出精品力作。强调思想精深、艺术精湛、制作精良相统一，实际上是在中国特色社会主义进入新时代的历史条件下对“什么是优秀文艺作品、创作什么样的优秀文艺作品”所作出的创新性回答。其中，“思想精深”指向文艺作品的“思想标准”，“艺术精湛”关涉文艺作品的“审美标准”，“制作精良”则指向评判文艺作品的“质量标准”。判定一部文艺作品优秀与否，关键就在于看其是否实现了思想标准、审美标准和质量标准的统一。\n\n一、思想标准：倾向性·真实性·情感性\n\n“思想精深”是从思想意蕴层面对文艺作品提出的要求，主要涉及对文艺作品倾向性之正误善恶、真实性之有无高低、情感性之强弱浓淡的考量。思想标准在内涵上比单纯的政治标准、道德伦理标准、社会历史标准等要更为宽泛，且内在地包含政治、道德、伦理、社会、历史等方面的内容。好的文艺作品应当符合“善”、“真”、“情”的要求：在思想倾向性和价值导向性上是向上、向善的；在可信度上是内容真实、态度真诚的；在情感性上是将充沛的情感融注于作品之中，反映人民的真情实感，能够让人民从中体会到人间真情的。\n\n(一)倾向性。“善”指向文艺作品的思想倾向性和价值导向性，体现的是作品的道德、伦理内涵，决定着文艺作品被接受和认可的程度。习近平在文艺工作座谈会上的讲话中强调，文艺是给人以“价值引导”和“精神引领”的，文艺要有“对理想的抒发、对道德的引导”，要通过文艺作品“传递向上向善的价值观，引导人们增强道德判断力和道德荣誉感，向往和追求讲道德、尊道德、守道德的生活”；“好的文艺作品就应该像蓝天上的阳光、春季里的清风一样，能够启迪思想”，“能够扫除颓废萎靡之风”，“热衷于‘去思想化’、‘去价值化、‘去历史化’、‘去中国化’、‘去主流化’那一套，绝对是没有前途的”。⑥在中国文联十大、中国作协九大开幕式上的讲话中，习近平提出，“广大文艺工作者要对生活素材进行判断，弘扬正能量”，“要用有筋骨、有道德、有温度的作品”，“引导人们向高尚的道德聚拢，不让廉价的笑声、无底线的娱乐、无节操的垃圾淹没我们的生活”，“鼓舞人们在黑暗面前不气馁、在困难面前不低头，用理性之光、正义之光、善良之光照亮生活”。⑦倡导文艺作品“价值引导”、“精神引领”、“增强道德判断力和道德荣誉感”、“讲道德、尊道德、守道德”、“扫除颓废萎靡之风”、“弘扬正能量”、“向高尚的道德聚拢”，都是对文艺作品“善”的层面的要求。一部优秀文艺作品在思想倾向性方面应当是“善”的，这种“善”在当前条件下具体表现在：一要坚持和弘扬社会主义核心价值观。“核心价值观是一个民族赖以维系的精神纽带，是一个国家共同的思想道德基础”，⑧“倡导富强、民主、文明、和谐，倡导自由、平等、公正、法治，倡导爱国、敬业、诚信、友善”的社会主义核心价值观，是当代中国精神的集中体现，是凝聚中国力量的思想道德基础。“广大文艺工作者要把培育和弘扬社会主义核心价值观作为根本任务，坚定不移用中国人独特的思想、情感、审美去创作属于这个时代、又有鲜明中国风格的优秀作品。”⑨在文艺创作中坚持和弘扬社会主义核心价值观，是对文艺作品倾向性标准的充实。二要坚持以人民为中心。“人民既是历史的创造者，也是历史的见证者”；既是历史的“剧中人”，也是历史的“剧作者”，“以人民为中心”体现在中国特色社会主义事业的各个方面，文艺当然不能例外。一部文艺作品优秀与否，最根本之处在于它是否坚持了“以人民为中心的创作导向”，“是否能为人民抒写、为人民抒情、为人民抒怀”。⑩\n\n(二)真实性。“真”指向文艺作品的内容真实、态度真诚，它是对文艺作品可信度的反映。习近平反复强调，要“从最真实的生活出发”、“告诉人们真实的历史”，(11)这一切都是对文艺作品思想之“真”提出的具体要求。艺术之“真”具体表现在：第一，坚持历史真实，反对历史虚无化。历史为文艺创作提供了无穷的滋养和无限的想象空间，但文艺工作者不能用无端的想象去描写历史，更不能使历史虚无化。艺术当然不可能完全还原历史真实，但艺术家有责任告诉人们真实的历史，告诉人们历史中最有价值的东西。只有树立正确历史观，尊重历史、按照艺术规律呈现艺术化的历史，才能经得起历史的检验。第二，立足生活真实，反映时代要求。一时代有一时代之精神，优秀文艺作品是时代前进的号角，是折射时代精神的镜子，最能代表一个时代的风貌，最能引领一个时代的风气，文艺的性质决定了它必须以反映时代精神为神圣使命。“中国特色社会主义进入新时代”，(12)这是党的十九大报告对我国发展所处的新的历史方位所作出的重大科学判断。评判一部文艺作品优秀与否，重要标准之一就在于看它是否反映了中国特色社会主义新时代的要求，即是否围绕夺取中国特色社会主义伟大胜利、全面建设社会主义现代化强国、逐步实现全体人民共同富裕、奋力实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦以及日益走近世界舞台中央、不断为人类作出更大贡献等几个方面进行了书写和创作。第三，真诚直面现实，合理反映丑恶。文艺工作者在书写人民真实生活、反映人民真情实感的同时，也要明白生活中并非处处皆莺歌燕舞、花团锦簇。社会上还有许多不尽如人意之处、还存在一些丑恶现象。一部文艺作品优秀与否，一个重要方面就在于它是否做到了以真诚的态度去直面现实、正视丑恶。单纯记述现状、原始展示丑恶、过度渲染阴暗的作品不是好的作品。“只有把生活咀嚼透了，完全消化了，才能变成深刻的情节和动人的形象，创作出来的作品才能激荡人心。”(13)\n\n(三)情感性。“情”指向的是文艺作品的情感性，它是对文艺作品感染度的反映。习近平将文艺之‘情”贯穿于文艺工作从创作阶段到作品本身再到艺术效果的全过程，提出要“以充沛的激情……创作生产出人民喜闻乐见的优秀作品”，“能不能搞出优秀作品，最根本的决定于是否能……为人民抒情……”，“有没有感情，对谁有感情，决定着文艺创作的命运”，“要解决好‘为了谁、依靠谁、我是谁’这个问题，拆除‘心’的围墙，不仅要‘身入’，更要‘心入’、‘情入’”。(14)他强调，“要用心用情了解各种各样的人物”，“反映人民喜怒哀乐的真情实感”，把“美好的情感融入自己的作品”，“让人民从身边的人和事中体会到人间真情和真谛”；“只有用真诚的感情去体验生活才能够创作出伟大的作品”；“经典之所以能够成为经典，其中必然含有永恒的情，经典通过情感建构等，容纳了深刻流动的心灵世界和鲜活丰满的本真生命……因此才能成为不会过时的作品”。(15)在习近平看来，判断一部文艺作品是否具有“情感性”，主要看文艺工作者是否带着真诚的感情去创作，是否将充沛的激情融于作品之中，通过作品反映出人民的真情实感，并让人民能够从作品中体会到人间的真情。只有含‘情”的作品才是“有温度的”、“真诚的”作品，才能“鼓舞人们在黑暗面前不气馁、在困难面前不低头，用理性之光、正义之光、善良之光照亮生活”。(16)\n\n二、审美标准：审美评价·形象评价\n\n“艺术精湛”指向文艺作品的“审美标准”，它是从审美层面对文艺作品提出的要求，是衡量作品艺术性高低优劣的尺度，涉及文艺作品的艺术创造和艺术构成，最终目的是“给人以审美享受”和“审美启迪”。习近平指出，“要坚守文艺的审美理想、保持文艺的独立价值”，“提倡体裁、题材、形式、手段充分发展”；(17)“经典之所以能够成为经典，其中必然含有隽永的美、永恒的情、浩荡的气。经典通过主题内蕴、人物塑造、情感建构、意境营造、语言修辞等，容纳了深刻流动的心灵世界和鲜活丰满的本真生命，包含了历史、文化、人性的内涵，具有思想的穿透力、审美的洞察力、形式的创造力，因此才能成为不会过时的作品。”(18)习近平在这里提及的“坚守文艺的审美理想”、“保持文艺的独立价值”、“提倡体裁、题材、形式、手段充分发展”，以及通过“人物塑造、情感建构、意境营造、语言修辞”等使作品具备“审美的洞察力”、“形式的创造力”等，是从不同方面对文艺作品的“审美标准”提出的具体要求。这里，可以将审美标准具体化为“审美评价”和“形象评价”两个方面。\n\n(一)审美评价：是否“按照美的规律来创造”。马克思在《1844年经济学哲学手稿》中提出人“按照美的规律来构造”：“动物只是按照它所属的那个种的尺度和需要来建造，而人懂得按照任何一个种的尺度来进行生产，并且懂得处处都把内在的尺度运用于对象；因此，人也按照美的规律来构造。”(19)在马克思看来，按照美的规律来构造，是人类劳动区别于动物生产的重要标志，即审美对于人类劳动具有普遍的必然性与根本的引导性。具体到文艺生产层面，这要求创作出的文艺产品须遵循美学法则，体现出较高的艺术独创性和审美价值。习近平在文艺工作座谈会上的讲话中提出，“要坚守文艺的审美理想、保持文艺的独立价值”，“不断进行美的发现和美的创造”，努力以“文质兼美的优秀作品赢得人民喜爱和欢迎”，“让人们发现自然的美、生活的美、心灵的美”。(20)这实质上是对马克思的“按照美的规律来构造”在文艺层面的拓展和具体化。文艺之美的规律在此主要体现在文体、语言、修辞、结构、创作技巧与手法等形式美方面。艺术形式不仅是“表达一定思想和价值观念的载体”，而且“一切艺术创作……都是以艺术的形式反映生活的本质、提炼生活蕴含的真善美，从而给人以审美的享受、思想的启迪、心灵的震撼”。(21)看一部作品是否按照美的规律进行创造，就是看其是否遵循和运用形式美的法则去表现美的内容，最终达到了美的形式与美的内容的高度和谐统一。\n\n(二)形象评价：是否“真实地再现了典型环境中的典型人物”。形象评价主要同叙事作品相关，主要看叙事作品中人物形象塑造的个性化、创造性、典型性所达到的程度和特色。习近平指出，“文艺作品不是神秘灵感的产物，它的艺术性、思想性、价值取向总是通过文学家、艺术家对历史、时代、社会、生活、人物等方方面面的把握来体现”。(22)关于形象评价更具体的说法是“真实地再现典型环境中的典型人物”，这是恩格斯1888年在致《城市姑娘》这部小说的作者玛·哈克奈斯的信中最早提出的：“现实主义的意思是，除细节的真实外，还要真实地再现典型环境中的典型人物。”(23)评判一部文艺作品特别是有情节、叙事类的现实主义作品(譬如在小说、戏剧、影视剧中)优秀与否，关键在于看艺术家是否对典型人物作了具体而深刻的刻画，是否对现实关系作出了规律性把握和本质性揭示(即是否达到了艺术真实而不只是细节真实)，看作品能否通过人物之间错综复杂的关联冲突展示出历史现实的典型环境。习近平对文艺作品中的典型人物塑造作出过精辟论述：“典型人物所达到的高度，就是文艺作品的高度，也是时代的艺术高度。只有创作出典型人物，文艺作品才能有吸引力、感染力、生命力。广大文艺工作者要始终把人民的冷暖和幸福放在心中，把人民的喜怒哀乐倾注在自己的笔端，讴歌奋斗人生，刻画最美人物。”(24)把人物塑造同周围环境、时代背景联系起来，从而反映出一定时代社会生活的本质，这是马克思及恩格斯对现实主义文艺的优秀成果和创作经验所作出的科学总结，也是从形象方面衡量文艺作品好坏优劣的重要审美标准。\n\n三、质量标准：符合规格·受众需求\n\n“制作精良”指向文艺作品的“质量标准”，是衡量文艺作品自身品质高低以及满足读者/观众/听众需要、符合市场和社会需求程度的尺度。理解“质量标准”，须首先明确“质量”的两种主要含义：其一，符合规格。这是关于质量的传统定义，它是“产品—成本导向”的，主要着眼于产品本身的制作水平和品质高低。习近平在关于文艺工作的系列讲话中指出，当前我国文艺创作存在着“有数量缺质量”的现象；(25)“我国文艺不仅要有体量的增长，更要创造质量的标杆”，(26)要“克服浮躁这个顽疾，抵制急功近利、粗制滥造”，(27)“在艺术质量和水平上敢于实事求是”，(28)不断“提高文艺创作质量”，(29)“用专注的态度、敬业的精神、踏实的努力创作出更多高质量、高品位的作品”。(30)这里提到的“质量”、“水平”等是从文艺作品的制作水平和品质角度提出的要求，符合质量定义的“产品—成本导向”。其二，顾客需求。20世纪50年代，美国现代质量管理领军人物约瑟夫·朱兰(Joseph M.Juran)从顾客角度提出产品质量即产品的“适用性”，认为将顾客的效用和满意放在首位，这与顾客的感知质量是紧密相连的。(31)这一质量含义是“体验—收益导向”的，主要着眼于通过实现更高的顾客满意度以实现收益的增加。习近平指出，“随着人民生活水平不断提高，人民对包括文艺作品在内的文化产品的质量、品位、风格等的要求也更高了”。(32)这里提到的“质量”、“品位”涉及作品的需求层面。“符合规格”与“顾客需求”二者相辅相成、相互促进：品质优良的作品有助于满足受众需求，提升产品的市场和社会竞争力；而市场竞争反过来又会刺激产品质量和水平的提升。习近平在论及国产影片时对二者的关系进行了阐述：“当今世界是开放的世界，艺术也要在国际市场上竞争，没有竞争就没有生命力。比如电影领域，经过市场竞争，国外影片并没有把我们的国产影片打垮，反而刺激了国产影片提高质量和水平”。(33)“制作精良”这一文艺产品的质量评价标准，内在地包含“质量”的上述两方面含义。只有自身“符合规格”，即符合文艺产品行业标准和制作规范，同时满足“顾客需求”，即满足读者/观众/听众的视听需要并最终符合市场和社会需求，才算得上是“制作精良”的优秀文艺作品：\n\n(一)符合文艺产品行业标准和制作规范。这涉及宏观、中观、微观三个层面的具体要求：在宏观层面，如果文化文艺产品具有“国际标准”，就要看其是否符合“国际标准”。习近平指出，“国际经济合作和竞争局面正在发生深刻变化，全球经济治理体系和规则正在面临重大调整……增强参与全球经济、金融、贸易规则制订的实力和能力，在更高水平上开展国际经济和科技创新合作”。(34)以手机动漫文化产品为例，为适应我国手机动漫产业快速发展对标准化提出的迫切需求，我国主导制定了文化领域首个国际技术标准——手机(移动终端)动漫国际标准。(35)生产制作符合“国际标准”的手机动漫文化产品，才能赢得文化与科技融合发展的国际话语权，提高我国手机动漫产业在国际上的竞争力。在中观层面，要看制作的广播影视剧作、出版的文艺书籍等文化文艺产品，是否符合我国颁布的广播电影电视行业、新闻出版行业等的系列行业标准。在微观层面，要看文化文艺产品是否符合基本的生产规范和制作工艺流程。比如，对于出版的文艺书籍，要看其是否达到了印前在开本、材料、印刷与装帧工艺设计等方面设定的产品标准；看其印刷中的质量控制水平如何，是否避免了套印不准、重影、透印、脏版、墨色不一等影响印刷质量的因素；同时，也要看书籍装订是否符合装订质量要求等。\n\n(二)满足受众需要，并最终符合市场和社会需求。对于文艺产品而言，在需求方面的标准要看其是否精准地把握住了观众的需求，提升了观众的体验感；是否在人性化、个性化、互动性、差异化等方面下了一番功夫，提供有温度的、有品位的、高质量的观感和阅读体验；是否重视读者、观众、听众的反馈意见，并对反馈的问题进行及时监督和改进等。这一质量含义，从基本层面看是“需求导向的”，但最终旨意却是“收益导向的”，提供高质量、有品位、有温度的观感和体验，其最终目的在于通过实现更高的受众满意度，以期实现市场收益的增加和社会效果的提升。“收益需求”包括市场收益和社会效果两个方面。在市场条件下，一部制作水平好、观感体验高的文艺作品是与市场发行量、收视率、点击率、票房收入等量化指标直接挂钩的，能够直接反映在市场回报和经济收益上。就像习近平所说，“在发展社会主义市场经济的条件下，许多文化产品要通过市场实现价值，当然不能完全不考虑经济效益”；“优秀的文艺作品，最好是既能在思想上、艺术上取得成功，又能在市场上受到欢迎”。(36)文艺重视市场回馈、量化指标、经济回报，本无可厚非，但若把市场指标绝对化，唯经济效益是举，文艺就会沾满铜臭气，就会成为市场的奴隶。不可否认，当前我国文艺界也确实存在着一股专注于电影票房、电视剧收视率的趋势。只问经济效益、不问社会效益的文艺作品是背离人民利益的，是不能被称为好作品的。在评判文艺作品的需求标准上，既要看其市场收益，更要看重其社会效果，看其是否始终把社会效益放在首位。正如习近平所指出的，要“认真严肃地考虑作品的社会效果，讲品位，重艺德”；“一部好的作品……应该是把社会效益放在首位”，“同社会效益相比，经济效益是第二位的”，“当两个效益、两种价值发生矛盾时，经济效益要服从社会效益，市场价值要服从社会价值”。(37)\n\n一部文艺作品，倘若能够同时符合思想标准、审美标准、质量标准，达到“思想精深、艺术精湛、制作精良相统一”，就必定是一部优秀的文艺作品。但通常可能是：思想、艺术、制作质量在一部作品中的体现是不平衡的，或者作品的思想性很强而艺术性、制作上偏薄弱一些，或者艺术性较高、制作质量较好但思想性稍显不足。同时，由于社会发展和时代变迁等缘故，对同一部文艺作品的评判往往会存在差异，因此，思想标准、审美标准、质量标准三者之间的偏向也会不同。但总体而言，思想标准、审美标准、质量标准三者之间是密切联系、密不可分的。另外，需要说明的是，虽然可以从理论上指出思想标准、审美标准、质量标准的具体内涵和细化原则，但“优秀作品并不拘于一格、不形于一态、不定于一尊”，(38)在具体衡量文艺作品高下优劣的过程中，不能死板、教条地照搬和硬套。",

The review should address the following aspects: 1. Plot analysis: focus on analyzing the love story between Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu, including its ups and downs and complex emotional background; 2. Character portrayal: detailed analysis of major characters including Grandmother Jia, Wang Xifeng, Jia Baoyu, Lin Daiyu, and Xue Baochai; 3. Cultural implications: discuss the presentation of traditional culture, poetry and art, food and clothing details in the work; 4. Feudal criticism: analyze the author's profound reflection on feudal ethics, morality, and social systems through specific plot points; 5. Demonstrate the work's multiple interpretations and classic value through its different readings across various eras.\n\nThe main plot points, excerpt summaries, and basic information about the Qing Dynasty's social and cultural background can be referenced from: Main Plot Points and Paragraph Summaries of \"Dream of the Red Chamber\":\n\n1. The Stone and Flower's Previous Life (Chapter 1)\nLin Daiyu was originally a crimson pearl herb by the Spirit River in the heavenly realm, while Jia Baoyu was originally a stone left over from repairing the sky. The stone watered the herb with divine dew daily, nurturing it with heavenly essence until it transformed into a female form. Later, when the stone descended to the mortal world, the herb decided to follow and repay the stone's kindness with a lifetime of tears.\n\n2. Baoyu's Naming and First-Year Ceremony (Chapter 2)\nWhen Lady Wang gave birth to a son, he was born with a piece of luminous jade in his mouth, bearing inscriptions, hence named Baoyu. At his first birthday, Jia Zheng tested his future inclinations by surrounding him with various objects. Surprisingly, Baoyu chose cosmetics and hair ornaments, angering his father who predicted he would become a dissolute person. Baoyu was known for saying \"girls are made of water while boys are made of mud; I feel refreshed seeing girls but disgusted seeing boys.\"\n\n3. Wang Xifeng's First Appearance (Chapter 3)\nWhile Lin Daiyu was talking with Grandmother Jia, laughter was heard from the back courtyard. Unlike others' respectful demeanor, this person entered boldly. Dressed differently from other young ladies, she appeared like a divine fairy in magnificent embroidery. She immediately grabbed Daiyu's hand, praising her beauty and lamenting about Daiyu's mother, quickly switching between tears and laughter.\n\n4. First Meeting of Baoyu and Daiyu (Chapter 3)\nDuring their first meeting after dinner, both felt an instant familiarity. Baoyu gave Daiyu the nickname \"Frowner\" due to her furrowed brows. When Baoyu learned Daiyu had no jade, he called his own jade worthless and threatened to smash it, causing Daiyu great distress.\n\n5. Examining Each Other's Treasures (Chapter 8)\nWhen visiting the sick Baochai, Baoyu's jade inscription read \"Magic Jade\" with \"Never lose, never forget, eternal life and prosperity\" on one side and \"Dispel evil, heal grievances, know fortune and misfortune\" on the other. Baochai's gold locket had \"Never part, never leave, lasting youth\" inscribed, seemingly matching Baoyu's jade inscription.\n\n[Note: This is the first part of the translation.

Finally, attach a section for reference materials or recommended readings. Direct copying should be avoided; content should be original with detailed data. Actual classroom management cases from frontline primary and secondary school teachers can refer to: A Real Case Study of Classroom Management by a Frontline Primary and Secondary School Teacher:\n\nTeacher Li teaches in an ordinary middle school class. When she first took over the class, she faced many challenges. The classroom discipline was chaotic, with students frequently chatting and moving around randomly; homework completion was poor with serious plagiarism issues; some students lacked interest in learning and even showed resistance.\n\nTo improve this situation, Teacher Li first focused on building good teacher-student relationships. She spent time after class talking with students, understanding their interests, family backgrounds, and learning difficulties. Through sincere communication, students gradually felt Teacher Li's care and respect, and their attitude towards her changed from initial unfamiliarity and awe to closeness and trust.\n\nRegarding classroom rules, Teacher Li didn't take a simplistic \"one-size-fits-all\" approach but instead organized students to participate in discussions. Together, they established a series of rules that were both practical and accepted by students, such as being punctual for class, raising hands to speak, and respecting others' opinions. Since students participated in making these rules, they were more conscientious in following them.\n\nTeacher Li also emphasized creating a positive classroom atmosphere. She knew that a relaxed, pleasant learning environment could stimulate students' learning enthusiasm. Therefore, in her classes, she often included interesting stories, jokes, or engaging activities related to the course content. For example, when teaching geometric shapes in mathematics, she would have students work in groups to create various shapes with paper, deepening their understanding through hands-on activities. This teaching method not only made learning enjoyable but also enhanced their team cooperation awareness.\n\nFor students who performed poorly in class, Teacher Li never rushed to criticize but patiently sought to understand the reasons. Once, when a student frequently dozed off in class, she talked with him after class and discovered that his parents' frequent arguments were affecting his rest. After learning this, she contacted the parents, communicated about the situation, and eventually helped resolve the family issues, allowing the student to focus on learning.\n\nIn homework management, Teacher Li adopted a layered approach. She divided assignments into three levels - basic, advanced, and exploratory - based on students' abilities and levels. Students could choose assignments according to their actual capabilities. This method reduced pressure on struggling students while providing more challenges for advanced learners. She also carefully graded each assignment and wrote encouraging comments, making students feel their teacher's attention and expectations.\n\nTo motivate students, Teacher Li established a series of reward mechanisms. For example, she selected weekly \"Learning Star,\" \"Progress Star,\" and \"Discipline Star,\" posting recognition on the class bulletin board. These small honors were great encouragement for students, leading to noticeable improvements in both learning and behavior.\n\nAfter some time, Teacher Li's classroom management showed significant results.

{"index": 885, "domain1": "Academic & Engineering", "domain2": "Abstract", "query": "I need a research paper on quantum communication security to generate an abstract focusing on core algorithms and theoretical discussions within 250 words. The abstract should follow the standard academic format outline, including research background, methodology, core algorithms, theoretical findings, and significance. The target audience consists of quantum information researchers, requiring academic rigor in writing. The discussion should emphasize algorithm efficiency analysis, which is of particular interest to users, reflecting personalized needs.\nThe complete paper text or sections with marked abstract content, as well as the journal's submission format requirements (such as specific abstract format and word count limitations) can be referenced according to Quantum Communication Security Research Paper\n\nSecurity of Quantum Communication\n\nIn today's rapidly developing technological era, innovation in communication technology remains a crucial force driving social progress. Among these innovations, quantum communication, as a cutting-edge technology, is gradually emerging and attracting widespread attention and research. Quantum communication not only brings tremendous improvements in communication speed and efficiency, but its most prominent feature is its unparalleled security, while also showing broad prospects for future development.\n\nFirst, let's explore the security of quantum communication. Traditional communication methods, such as phones and internet that we use daily, face risks of information theft and tampering during transmission. However, quantum communication, based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, ensures communication security at its core.\n\nQuantum key distribution is one of the key technologies ensuring security in quantum communication. Its core principle relies on quantum non-cloning and the uncertainty principle. Simply put, any attempt to steal quantum keys will inevitably disturb the quantum state, which can be detected by communicating parties. This characteristic makes quantum keys theoretically \"absolutely secure.\"\n\nCompared to traditional encryption technology, quantum communication shows clear security advantages. Traditional encryption algorithms, no matter how complex, always have the possibility of being cracked. As computational power continues to increase, some previously considered secure encryption algorithms may become unreliable. However, quantum communication's security doesn't rely on mathematical complexity but on physical laws, creating an impregnable defense for information security.\n\nMoreover, quantum communication can effectively prevent \"man-in-the-middle attacks.\" In traditional communication, attackers can intercept and tamper with information without the communicating parties' knowledge. In quantum communication, such attack methods are almost impossible due to the special properties of quantum states.\n\nLooking ahead to the future development of quantum communication:\n\nIn the future, quantum communication is expected to be widely applied in multiple fields. The financial sector, involving large amounts of monetary transactions and sensitive information, has extremely high requirements for communication security. Quantum communication can provide secure and reliable communication protection for financial transactions, preventing information leakage and tampering, ensuring financial market stability and security.\n\nThe same applies to government affairs. Communication between government departments often involves state secrets and important decisions. The application of quantum communication can ensure secure transmission of government information, improving government work efficiency and decision-making accuracy.\n\nIn national defense and military aspects, quantum communication's significance is even greater. The confidentiality and reliability of military communications directly relate to national security and war outcomes. Quantum communication can provide absolutely secure communication means for military command and intelligence transmission, enhancing national military defense capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, as quantum communication technology continues to mature, its applications will expand to energy, transportation, healthcare, and many other fields.\n\nHowever, there are still challenges to achieve widespread application of quantum communication:\n\nTechnically, the transmission distance and efficiency of quantum communication still need improvement. Although certain breakthroughs have been achieved, solving a series of technical problems is necessary to realize long-distance, large-scale quantum communication networks.\n\nCost is also a significant limiting factor. Currently, the manufacturing and maintenance costs of quantum communication equipment are relatively high, which somewhat limits its large-scale promotion and application.\n\nAdditionally, quantum communication technology standards and specifications are not yet unified, creating difficulties for interconnection between different equipment and systems.\n\nDespite these challenges, the future development of quantum communication remains promising. Researchers continue to work on overcoming technical difficulties, reducing costs, and promoting the practicalization and industrialization of quantum communication technology.\n\nGovernments and enterprises are also giving high attention and strong support to quantum communication development, increasing research investment, promoting industry-academia-research cooperation, and accelerating innovation and application of quantum communication technology.\n\nIn conclusion, quantum communication, as a revolutionary technology, provides new ideas and methods for information-age communication security. Although some problems and challenges currently exist, with continuous technological progress and development, quantum communication will play an increasingly important role in future communication fields, bringing more convenience and security to our lives and social development.\n\nWe have reason to believe that in the near future, quantum communication will become a mainstream technology in the communication field, leading us into a more secure and efficient information age. Let us wait and witness together the development and application of this great technology..", "checklist": [{"name": "Abstract Structure Adherence", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response follows the standard academic abstract format with research background, methodology, core algorithms, theoretical findings, and significance as requested in the query.", "1-2": "Completely fails to provide an abstract structure.

{"index": 915, "domain1": "Politics & Law", "domain2": "Policy Interpretation", "query": "Write an article on the policy interpretation and implementation forecast of the latest judgment rules in the field of administrative litigation. The article should follow the general format of policy interpretation, including but not limited to the following structure: 1. Introduction (background of the latest judgment rules and the reasons for their introduction); 2. Key points of the judgment rules analysis (analyzing the core content and impact of each rule); 3. Practical application in administrative litigation (using typical or hypothetical cases, explain in detail how the judgment rules function in administrative litigation); 4. Future implementation forecast (analyze the prospects for implementation from perspectives such as judicial practice, law enforcement operability, possible challenges, and countermeasures). The article should be no less than 3000 words, with a writing style that is both authoritative and readable, suitable for government officials, legal practitioners, and law students. At the same time, please explain the content of the article in combination with the actual judgment rules, avoiding generalities, and provide a detailed analysis of certain representative judgment provisions. If feasible, include a reference analysis of a real event and cite real data. Finally, please analyze the professional tone based on the author's identity—‘a policy researcher with a legal background’. The original document or authoritative interpretation materials of the latest judgment rules can refer to Interpretation of the Supreme People's Court Ruling Rules  \nThe ruling rules of the Supreme People's Court mainly include a series of norms and principles that should be followed in case rulings. These rules ensure the fairness, consistency, and predictability of the judiciary. The following is an interpretation of some of the Supreme People's Court ruling rules:  \n\nI. General Principles of Rulings  \nFact-based and law-guided: This is the basic principle of rulings, requiring courts to strictly base their judgment on facts and correctly apply the law when hearing cases.  \nJustice, fairness, and openness: Rulings should be impartial and fair, treating all parties equally. At the same time, the trial process and results should be open and subject to public supervision.  \n\nII. Ruling Rules in Civil Litigation  \nIn civil litigation, the ruling rules of the Supreme People's Court focus on protecting the legal rights and interests of the parties involved, ensuring the legitimacy and fairness of the litigation process. For example, a ruling on personal safety protection does not automatically become evidence of domestic violence, which reflects the court's careful consideration of personal privacy and family relationships in its rulings. At the same time, when the court handles cases involving the division of marital property or the recovery of child support, it rules based on different legal relationships, ensuring that the interests of all parties are properly addressed.  \n\nIII. Ruling Rules in Criminal Litigation  \nIn criminal litigation, the ruling rules of the Supreme People's Court emphasize the importance of evidence and the legitimacy of the process. For example, in cases where there are criminal facts but no evidence or insufficient evidence, the court cannot convict, reflecting the principle of \"presumption of innocence.\" At the same time, the court rigorously examines the legality, authenticity, and relevance of evidence in its rulings to ensure the accuracy of conviction and sentencing.  \n\nIV. Preparation and Standardization of Ruling Documents  \nThe Supreme People's Court also has strict requirements for the preparation of ruling documents. As a type of ruling document, a judgment must clearly state the outcome of the ruling and the reasons for making that ruling. This ensures the transparency and comprehensibility of the ruling, making it easier for the parties involved and the public to understand the basis and reasoning of the court’s decision.  \n\nIn summary, the ruling rules of the Supreme People's Court are an important safeguard for ensuring judicial fairness, consistency, and predictability. These rules not only guide courts in how to correctly apply the law and determine facts when hearing cases but also standardize the preparation and requirements of ruling documents, thereby enhancing the credibility and authority of the judiciary..", "checklist": [{"name": "Legal Accuracy and Comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the response's accuracy in interpreting the judgment rules in administrative litigation, including the precision of legal terminology, comprehensiveness of coverage, and correct analysis of the rules' implications.", "1-2": "Contains significant legal inaccuracies, misinterprets fundamental aspects of the judgment rules, or omits essential legal principles that govern administrative litigation.

It is also recommended to include 2-3 constitutional review cases from countries or regions with wide influence.

Major constitutional review real-case materials can refer to **Environmental Law Case**\n\n1. The Case of Yucheng Chemical Co., Ltd. in Kaifeng City, Henan Province Discharging Hazardous Waste through Underground Pipes\n\n**Case Summary**\n\nAround 7:00 PM on August 2, 2023, law enforcement officers from the Yuwangtai Branch of the Kaifeng City Ecological Environment Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Yuwangtai Branch) conducted routine law enforcement inspections in the Yuwangtai Fine Chemical Park using drones. They discovered a suspicious tanker truck in the production workshop of Kaifeng Yucheng Chemical Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Yucheng Co.) under the building, being filled with production wastewater from a storage tank on the roof of the workshop via a hose. The officers immediately surveilled the area around the company, closely monitoring the movement of the tanker truck. Around 10:00 PM that night, the tanker truck left the company premises, stopped several times along the way to observe, and stayed for an extended period near the Jia Luhe Bridge on Kaiwei Road. The truck then drove to an abandoned duck farm in Weishi County, where the driver and accompanying personnel discharged the production wastewater (which was later identified as hazardous waste) into the river through an underground hidden pipe previously laid. The Yuwangtai Branch immediately reported the situation to the Weishi Branch of the Kaifeng City Ecological Environment Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Weishi Branch), and together with local law enforcement, they controlled the tanker driver and accompanying personnel at the scene.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that this case involved a well-organized, inter-provincial hazardous waste discharge operation across Henan, Shandong, and Hubei provinces. The Kaifeng City Ecological Environment Bureau and the Municipal Public Security Bureau formed a joint task force. The task force retrieved 46 GPS trajectories of the vehicles involved, analyzed 54 mobile phones, and processed over 500,000 data entries, including bank statements and WeChat records. After thorough analysis, they captured over 20 suspects from various locations, including Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hubei, Guangdong, Tibet, Xinjiang, Shandong, and other regions.\n\nIt was discovered that since February 2023, Yucheng Co. and three other chemical companies, due to insufficient capacity to handle high-concentration industrial wastewater, had contacted Chen Mowang, Zhou Mofan, and others in Weishi County through online platforms such as Baidu Tieba, Douyin, and WeChat groups to illegally dispose of the wastewater. They agreed on a disposal fee of 200 to 500 yuan per ton. Wang Mowei, Wang Moli, and others in Weishi County preemptively laid underground pipes at an abandoned duck farm on the west bank of a river in Weishi County to discharge wastewater directly into the river. Chen Mowang, Zhou Mofan, and others arranged for qualified tanker drivers to transport the high-concentration wastewater via official procedures to avoid inspections, bringing it into Weishi County, where Wang Mowei, Wang Moli, and others guided the drivers to the discharge location. They then used the pre-installed underground pipes to discharge the wastewater into the river. A total of 14 tanker trucks (approximately 420 tons) of hazardous waste were illegally discharged, resulting in profits of over 300,000 yuan.\n\n**Investigation and Handling**\n\nAccording to Article 338 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China and Item 5 of Article 1 of the Interpretation of Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Handling of Environmental Pollution Criminal Cases by the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the actions of Wang Mowei, Wang Moli, and others in illegally disposing of hazardous waste are suspected of committing the crime of environmental pollution.\n\nOn August 10, 2023, the Weishi Branch transferred the case to the Weishi County Public Security Bureau. Through a joint investigation by law enforcement and environmental authorities, 26 suspects were arrested. From February to April 2024, the Weishi County People's Court sentenced 13 individuals, including Chen Mobin, to prison terms ranging from nine months to five months and imposed fines for the crime of environmental pollution. Other cases are still under trial.\n\n**Social Equality Case**\n\n2. Jane Elliott v. Massachusetts Case\n\nIn the early 1960s, racial segregation still existed in American schools, resulting in Black students not having equal educational opportunities. In this case, Jane Elliott, a Black girl, was denied admission to a white school in Massachusetts. The Supreme Court's ruling allowed Elliott to enter the school, marking a gradual end to the racial segregation policies in the U.S. and emphasizing the significance and importance of the principle of equality..", "checklist": [{"name": "Comic Style and Teen Engagement", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response uses comic-style language and engaging elements specifically tailored for teenagers, including interactive components (Q&A, dialogue) and appropriate tone that makes constitutional review appealing.", "1-2": "No comic-style elements present;

{"index": 925, "domain1": "Literature & Arts", "domain2": "Biography", "query": "Write a comprehensive and in-depth biography of Jane Austen, with a word count of no less than 5000 words, focusing on her six novels. Specifically, explore her profound interpretation of female characters and their relationship with the societal expectations of early 19th-century England. The analysis should demonstrate the conflict between female personal desires and social constraints in her works, as well as her sharp insights into themes such as marriage, family, and economic independence. Additionally, provide a detailed explanation of the creative background, including how the social and family life Austen experienced influenced her views and writing. Finally, using key events from her life, illustrate the cultural and historical significance of the classic female characters she created. The text should include specific plot details and character analyses, and incorporate important academic and critical viewpoints to enrich the depth of the article. The main plots and character analyses of Jane Austen’s six novels can refer to **Main Plot and Character Analysis**  \n1. The first draft of *Pride and Prejudice* was written from October 1796 to August 1797, originally titled *First Impressions*. After several revisions over the course of several years, it was renamed *Pride and Prejudice* and was published on January 28, 1813. This novel, centered around a romantic entanglement, depicts the relationship between the proud bachelor Darcy and the prejudiced Elizabeth, reflecting the author's views on marriage and emphasizing the influence of economic interests on love and marriage. The plot is rich with comedic elements, and the language is witty and humorous, making it one of the most popular novels of Austen. Austen herself once called *Pride and Prejudice* her \"darling child.\" The famous American literary critic Edmund Wilson (1895–1972) once said, \"Over the past century, there have been several revolutions in taste in English literature that affected almost every writer's reputation, but only Shakespeare and Jane Austen have remained unaffected by the passing years.\" Austen's six novels, tested by more than two hundred years of time, have been praised by generations of readers and are all considered masterpieces. Especially *Pride and Prejudice*, it is truly a rare gem in the world’s literary treasures, which is why Maugham included it in his list of the top ten greatest novels of the world.  \n2. *Sense and Sensibility* is Jane Austen's first novel. The initial draft, written in 1796, was a letter-based novel titled *Elinor and Marianne*, and was later rewritten into *Sense and Sensibility* in November 1797. After more than a decade of relative silence, Austen revealed in a letter in March 1811 that she had seen the proofs of the book in London. The book was published on October 30 of the same year. The novel revolves around the two female protagonists' search for suitable husbands and critically reveals the prevalent attitude in British society, where marriage was seen as a means for women to secure financial stability and elevate their social standing. It also critiques the ugly fashion of valuing family status over women's feelings and rights. Both female protagonists seek equal communication and understanding with men and insist on the freedom to independently observe, analyze, and choose their partners. In the context of 19th-century England, this was almost a rebellious outcry. As the title suggests, the story focuses on the conflict between \"sense\" and \"sensibility.\" The protagonist Elinor, who is both emotionally aware and rational, represents the author’s ideal that one should not lack feelings, but feelings should be governed by reason.  \n3. *Emma* was begun on January 21, 1814, completed by March 29, 1815, and was published by the end of 1815 or early 1816. Like several of Austen's other novels, *Emma* is a love story, but its development is less complicated, with no shocking or sensational events. Unlike the heroines in Austen's other novels, who are often without money or influence, Emma is the daughter of a wealthy and influential gentleman. She is somewhat self-important, enjoys doing as she pleases, has firmly decided not to marry, yet delights in matchmaking others. After creating many misunderstandings and experiencing some misfortunes, Emma eventually falls in love herself. Many critics consider *Emma* Austen's mature work, not only because of its depth in portraying society and human relations but also due to the frequent use of psychological portrayal in the narrative. The author uses psychological description to develop the plot and shape the characters, which was relatively rare in the writing scene at that time. No wonder Virginia Woolf remarked that if Austen had lived 20 more years, she would have been regarded as a precursor to James and Proust!  \n4. *Mansfield Park* began being written in February 1811, two years before *Pride and Prejudice* was published, and was completed shortly after June 1813. It is believed to have been released by the end of May 1814. Like several other novels by Austen, *Mansfield Park* focuses on the romantic relationships of young men and women, but the plot is more complex, with more concentrated sudden events and a stronger sense of social satire. It exposes the affected and ridiculous nature of the British upper class. While *Mansfield Park* was published only a year after *Pride and Prejudice*, the tone and atmosphere of the two works are quite different. *Pride and Prejudice* is light and bright, while *Mansfield Park* is heavier, with a more obvious moralizing tone. However, it marks a major breakthrough in psychological portrayal and narrative technique and is a milestone in the development of English fiction, showing that by the time she wrote *Mansfield Park*, Jane Austen had become a relatively mature female writer.  \n5. Austen began writing the first draft of *Northanger Abbey* in 1798 and completed it in 1799, but then left it aside for several years. In 1803, she revised it and retitled it *Susan*, selling the rights to a London publisher for ten pounds in the spring of that year. However, for unknown reasons, the book was never published. In 1816, her brother Henry Austen bought back the manuscript of *Susan* and had Austen revise it again. By the end of December 1817, *Northanger Abbey* was published along with *Persuasion*. The story follows Catherine, the daughter of a country parson, who is obsessed with Gothic horror novels and sometimes mistakes real life for the fictional world of those tales. She is introduced to social circles and befriends the insincere Thorpe siblings while falling in love at first sight with the upright and handsome young heir Henry. Catherine is invited by Henry's father, General Tilney, to visit their family home at Northanger Abbey. In the eerie, ancient house, Catherine imagines horrific scenarios from Gothic novels, leading to a series of amusing adventures. The snobbish General Tilney, who listens to slander from the Thorpes, coldly expels Catherine. However, the two young lovers do not give up, and after some twists and turns, they eventually marry. Like Austen's other novels, *Northanger Abbey* is a humorous and witty comedy, with vivid, well-rounded characters, lively dialogues, and strong individuality, making it feel as if the reader can hear their voices and see them in person. It is no wonder that critics often compare her to Shakespeare.  \n6. *Persuasion* began on August 8, 1815, and the first draft was completed on July 18, 1816, with the final version completed on August 6. The book tells a convoluted love story. Anne Elliot, a noblewoman, falls deeply in love with the young naval officer Frederick Wentworth and they become engaged. However, her father, Sir Walter Elliot, and her godmother, Lady Russell, disapprove of Wentworth because of his low birth and lack of fortune, strongly opposing the marriage. Anne, being \"prudent,\" accepts her godmother's advice and painfully breaks off the engagement. Eight years later, Wentworth, now a captain with wealth and rank, returns home on leave and becomes a tenant at Sir Walter Elliot's house, staying with his sister and brother-in-law. Though he still holds a grudge against Anne, the two lovers have not forgotten their past feelings. After many difficulties, they overcome the interference of others and are eventually reunited.  \n*Persuasion* is significant not only for its poignant love story but also for its moral exploration of love and prudence. More importantly, it has profound social implications, offering a scathing critique of the decaying nobility and the hereditary aristocracy. Artistically, *Persuasion* does not seek unusual plots, but is known for its tight structure and delicate style. Many of the details seem plain at first, yet upon deeper reflection, they leave a lingering aftertaste..", "checklist": [{"name": "Comprehensiveness_and_Word_Count", "criteria_description": "Evaluates whether the response provides a comprehensive biography of Jane Austen with sufficient depth, reaching the required minimum of 5000 words, and covering all requested aspects of her life and work.", "1-2": "Severely insufficient word count (under 2000 words) with major gaps in biographical information.

"基于我作为护肤博主之前发布的一篇敏感肌护理心得，需要改编成3-5分钟的短视频文案。主打'敏感肌日常护理'主题，文风要轻松自然但专业可信，适合25-35岁都市白领女性观看。语言风格要体现我5年敏感肌护理经验，多用'共情表达。最终文案要突出专业性和实用性，并与我个人经历相结合，便于后期拍摄剪辑。\n1.原护肤心得文章内容。2.博主个人敏感肌护理经历的关键案例可以参照护肤心得\n    岁月是女人最大的敌人，而容貌是出卖女人的凶手，每个女人都\n想要保住年轻的容貌，每个女人都想要青春常驻，每个女人都想要掩\n盖脸上的细纹，眼圈，斑点，总之就是一切一切岁月的痕迹。而每个\n阶段的女性都应该用符合这个年龄层次的护肤品，二十岁的年龄不应\n该用二十五岁的护肤品。护肤品用的正确可以帮你细致皮肤，掩盖岁\n月的痕迹，如果用得不适当，则会加快皮肤的衰老速度，所以每个女\n性都要找到适合自己用的护肤品，而且是适合自己现在年龄阶段用的\n护肤品。\n    说了那么多，我也不想兜圈子了，我就给大家说一下我的护肤心\n得吧。首先除了外用的护肤品，吃的东西也很重要，大家要注意自己\n吃的东西，而且俗话说，女人是水做的，所以女性朋友们一定要注意\n多喝水，每天保证八杯水。好的东西，有益的东西太多了，水果和有\n益身体的东西要多吃点。\n    下面我就介绍一下外用的护肤品给大家吧。首先是Marieclaire，\n不知道大家是否知道这个牌子，这个品牌应该是07年的时候才进入中\n国市场的，是《嘉人》杂志的品牌，在国外知名度和声誉都很高，我\n很早之前就已经知道这个品牌了。特别要说一下这款的银杏保湿面霜，\n我的皮肤比较干燥，又敏感，容易过敏，从几年前一直使用这款产品，\n这款面霜是朋友介绍我使用，用过后，挺滋润的，总的来说这款用起\n来真的挺滋润的，很容易被皮肤吸收，气味清香，使用之后皮肤还特\n光滑有弹性，皱纹减少了皮肤也变得嫩了感觉很不错价钱也不贵值得\n一提的，他得质地很好，不会太过厚重，也不会很轻薄。\n    让皮肤更有弹性，摸起来很饱满，我一直都在用这款面霜，而且\nMarieclaire的产品针对不同年龄的女性设计，每个年龄阶段对应相应\n的护肤产品。因为之前很难在这里找到，因为专柜都是这两年才进入\n中国市场的，以前都是托朋友从香港那边给我带过来，不过现在好了，\n我在淘宝上面找到了一家店铺，里边专卖护肤品，有Marieclaire。\n    我现在都是在这家店铺淘的护肤品，都是原装进口的，专柜正品\n绝无假货。\n    大家可以去看一下。其次是我在最近发现一个蛮好用的一个牌子\n是掌柜介绍用的，叫做山中采药，山中采药的平衡理论是凝聚了中国\n美容经典的精华。中医学强调“理气血，调阴阳”，人体方能维持正\n常状态。现代医学认为，人体各部分都存在自身平衡调节机制。肌肤\n也不例外。现代生活，节奏加快、环境污染、气候不适等多种因素都\n在影响肌肤自身调节的平衡状态，产生皮脂分泌过多及缺水干燥的状\n况。这个是用中药理念来护肤美容，这个品牌的产品，效果也不错。\n大家可以到我上面介绍的那家店铺咨询一下掌柜，她会向你介绍哪一\n款护肤品适合你用的。女人要懂得保养自己啊。\n    前两天《精品》的编辑阿宝对我进行了一个简短的电话采访，关\n于旅行护肤的。让我推荐几种我喜欢的护肤品和化妆品。\n    其实我对这些还是挺有研究的，因为从中学开始皮肤状况就不太\n稳定，有时候有小痘痘，有时候又特别干，最近一段时间才稳定一些。\n其间我尝试过各种各样的护肤品，种类繁多的程度，足能写出一份几\n万字的调查报告了。\n    我很喜欢用倩碧的东西，最近爱上了那个粉色的水嫩保湿霜，补\n水效果很好却不油，睡觉前抹上厚厚的一层，早上起来就会感觉皮肤\n很好呢。坐飞机的时候也总是用它，因为机舱里的干燥程度是沙漠的\n数倍。我以前都是用补水喷雾，却感觉更加干燥，后来才知道喷雾挥\n发的时候，反而会带走皮肤本身的一些水分。现在我总是在起飞前抹\n上一层保湿霜，或者兰芝的睡眠面膜，这样就省去了喷雾，可以一直\n踏实睡到飞机降落拉。\n    阿宝编辑问我出门旅行的时候，会携带哪些护肤品和化妆品。我\n觉得整套的护肤品必不可少，因为出门在外，水土和气候的不同本来\n就容易让皮肤敏感，所以护肤的步骤一定不能缩水。\n    相反化妆品倒是可以少带一些，隔离霜必不可少，我一直在用植\n村秀泡沫隔离霜，有防晒的成分，又可以使肤色更均匀，控油保湿的\n效果也不错。\n    平时我用液体粉底比较多一些，但是出差或者旅行的话，就带一\n个粉饼和一个遮瑕膏，粉底液和散粉就留在家里了，它们实在是太占\n地方了。最近新买了一个MAC的C30号，感觉颜色适合我，也很服\n帖，挺自然的。如果你的肤色不是偏黄而是偏粉的，那就选择NC30\n号吧！\n    我的遮瑕膏是RMK的2号，和我的液体粉底是一个牌子，所以和\nMAC的粉饼搭配，颜色似乎不如和粉底液一起用那般匹配。不过遮瑕\n过后再用粉饼轻拍上一层，效果也不错。\n    以前写过一篇《护手护发秘笈》，说好了接着再写《护肤秘笈》\n的，结果一放就是快一年，觉得真是怪对不起女同胞们的。上次看到\n有国内的同胞说喜欢在临睡前什么都不擦，让肌肤放松，百合真是吓\n了一大跳，晚上是保养皮肤的最佳时机，该给她吃饭喝水的时候你不\n喂，用不了多久恐怕会变成木乃伊。皮肤几乎相当于女人的第二生命，\n不好好对待她怎么可以呢。\n    在日本作皮肤护理不像在国内那样价格便宜，所以像我这样居家\n过日子的小百姓平时根本舍不得去美容院(做头发除外)。还好日本的化\n妆品物美价廉，花同样的价格在日本一定可以买到质量更好的化妆品，\n还可以通过很多渠道获得丰富的护肤知识，名演员和艺人们在媒体上\n也很愿意毫无保留的和人们分享自己的美容秘方。百合去资生堂总部\n参加过两次皮肤保养和化妆的讲座，资生堂的老师讲最好的美容器就\n是人的双手。日本女人们即使不去美容院，也可以通过自己的双手和\n化妆品将皮肤保养在不错的状态。百合现在迫不及待的想和大家分享\n一下基础护肤心得以及几个小秘笈，希望大家都变得越来越美丽。\n    我们每天使用的最基础护颜产品应该有这几样：洗颜膏、化妆水、\n乳液和防晒霜，化妆的人则必须使用卸妆产品，你不洗脸就睡觉没有\n问题，但一定不能不卸妆就睡觉。想给肌肤补充更多营养或者达到特\n定效果的人可以在乳液前使用美容液，乳液后使用面霜，另外最好定\n期用去死皮膏、面膜和按摩膏给肌肤做深层清洁和护理。百合除了面\n霜和按摩膏以外都用，日常用的4样摆在外面，去死皮膏和面膜平时\n收起来，每周拿出来用一次，很好管理。\n    每天基础护肤顺序是这样的：(卸妆)——洁面——化妆水—一(美\n容液、精华素之类)——乳液——(面霜)——防晒产品(白天必须用)\n    洗颜产品基本上分三类：泡沫类、膏状和香皂类。百合不喜欢不\n爱出泡的膏状洗颜产品，喜欢用第一类和第三类。大多数洗颜产品最\n重要的是打出丰富的泡沫，利用泡沫的力量来吸附出毛孔的脏东西。\n要打出广告里的丰富泡沫需要一定的技巧，但是一个打泡网可以让每\n一个人都能够轻松的打出丰富泡沫，打泡网绝对值得拥有。在日本流\n行着品种繁多的香皂类洗面产品，有很多效果非常优秀，足以打破人\n们对皂类产品不够高档的偏见。使用皂类洗面产品同样少不了打泡网\n的帮助。\n    洗颜完毕立刻就要做的事情是拍化妆水。化妆水最大的作用就是\n给皮肤补水，容易被忽略的是洗脸或洗澡之后要立即给皮肤补水，绝\n不能等待。我洗完澡后第一重视保暖，第二就是立刻给面部补水。就\n在你穿衣服的时间里，皮肤正在飞快地丧失着最重要的水分。所以在\n孩子们还小我必须和他们一起洗澡的时候，我尽量避免和他们同时出\n浴，通常是围上大浴巾或者穿上浴袍之后立刻就冲到洗手池前拍化妆\n水。\n    化妆水可以按照说明书的量使用，我通常按照自己皮肤的需求使\n用，有一种说法是拍化妆水的时候只要皮肤还可以吸收就说明她需要，\n就要尽量喂她喝饱。百合一般对皮肤是有求必应，所以化妆水的使用\n量是普通的两三倍。化妆水可以不用很高档的，但是一定要舍得用，\n量一定要足。在日本有的女人自己去药店买来原料和纯净水，自制成\n本很低的化妆水，尽情的使用。拍化妆水也有技巧，使用化妆棉会更\n加均匀的.给肌肤补水，但是消费得更厉害。因此百合不用化妆棉，每\n次用化妆水拍肌肤大约年龄乘3的次数，还有人用年龄乘5，你对皮肤\n的爱心一定会传达得到的，经过足够拍打的皮肤最后反弹给你的声音\n都不一样。\n    抹乳液的诀窍是将乳液倒到手心里等一下，将之尽量温暖到近似\n肌肤的温度再抹，抹匀后用双手手掌在脸上贴一会儿。别看小小的一\n番功夫，乳液里的营养会更好地渗透到肌肤里，发挥出更大的作用。\n    在此提醒姐妹们一定要用防晒霜。紫外线照射是皮肤衰老的第一\n大原因。紫外线虽然看不见，但是除了夜晚几乎随时随地都存在，无\n论室内还是室外，无论是晴天还是阴天都要使用防晒霜。防晒霜的系\n数不同，可以按照自己的爱好选用，一般大约2-3小时需要重新涂一\n次。百合的皮肤唯独对防晒霜挑剔，太便宜的皮肤会产生抗拒而发痒，\n在此推荐资生堂的ANESSA，SPF32，大约人民币150元左右，既不\n需要特别的清洗产品，效果也不错，价钱实惠又禁用。\n    虽然有人说我很禁晒，但是等你上了年纪的时候潜伏在皮肤深处\n的色斑之类的就会渐渐现出来了，不信就试一试。还有人说那外国人\n还喜欢故意晒黑呢，我们不是外国人，和他们对皮肤颜色的审美意识\n不同，而且你有没有机会去近距离观察一下欧美MM的皮肤，毛孔粗\n大，充满了雀斑，只可远瞻不可近看，而且老得也特别快。不注意防\n晒甚至故意学外国MM去晒黑皮肤的MM将来一定会有后悔的一天。\n    最后顺便提一下胶原蛋白产品。牢记一句话，抹的不如吃的，吃\n人工的不如天然的。但是天然的富含胶元蛋白的食品比如猪蹄、肉皮\n以及鸡翅等等往往卡路里也高，多吃才会有效果，但是也要当心不要\n长胖了。吃富含胶原蛋白的食品或者口服产品也有讲究，第一要在晚\n上，第二要和富含维生素的食品一起吃或者同时口服维生素，这样胶\n元蛋白才会在体内得到更好的吸收。\n    关于基础护肤心得就说这么多，今年冬天还在电视上向名演员学\n了一招睡觉时带口罩护肤的秘笈，可惜戴上的第一天早上就发现口罩\n整整齐齐的放在桌子上，不用说一定是百合梦游时摘掉的。任何一个\n好习惯的养成都需要时间和努力，不依靠名贵的化妆品，了解自己的\n皮肤，用恰当的方法，使用自己的双手用爱心和诚意为皮肤一点一滴\n的坚持努力下去，总有一天你会收到应得的回报。\n博主个人敏感肌护理经历的关键案例\n作为一名重度护肤脑，可以说冬季科学护肤才是重头戏！\n冬季对于大多数人来说，绝对是一项巨大的挑战。\n\n因为冬天的空气不仅干燥，质量还很差，很容易出现各种皮肤问题：干燥、粗糙、过敏、脱皮，严重的会出现脸颊刺痛等不适...\n\n再加上长时间待在暖气、空调间，冷热空气交替，起皮、泛红等更是常事。\n\n更糟糕的是，皮肤干燥，含水量下降，肌肤中的胶原蛋白、弹性纤维受损，会让皮肤失去弹性、松弛下垂，甚至会加速衰老\n作为一个及其爱护自己脸蛋的护肤博主，脸蛋就是我的门面，我觉得不会放任自己的门面而不顾的！\n\n为了我的美丽脸蛋子，我也是费了不少方法，甚至找到了学医的好集美，共同探讨为什么冬季皮肤会出现泛红、起皮等问题\n\n据专业的学医闺蜜解释：\n\n冬季出现以上问题都是皮肤变敏感的直接变现，不论是什么原因导致皮肤变得敏感，归根结底都是皮肤屏障受到了损伤！\n\n你们的皮肤角质在上面一系列的操作下变薄、变脆弱了，皮肤水分大大流失、运作系统瘫痪，\n\n导致角质中的皮肤屏障受损后无法正常自愈，皮肤状态越来越坏，爆发泛红、刺痛、起皮等恶性情况，最终走向敏感肌！\n\n想要在冬季好好护肤，就做到三点：温和清洁+舒缓补水+修复屏障\n\n展开说就是：\n\n①氨基酸：温和清洁\n②含葡聚糖：舒缓补水\n③神经酰胺：修复皮肤屏障\n后续我学医的闺蜜给我选了三种护肤品，让我用到日常护肤中，没有想到长时间使用下来，皮肤是一天比一天好。\n想到之前有很多姐妹们问过我，冬季该怎么护肤？\n\n今天我就将这个方法写下来，希望能帮助像我一样的冬季不知道该如何护肤的集美们！\n\n首先是温和清洁面部的氨基酸洗面奶。\n这里敲重点，清洁对于护肤很重要是没错，\n\n但很多朋友陷入了一个误区，深层清洁、多重清洁力求把脸洗的很干净！\n\n事实上，这样不仅会破坏皮肤微生态平衡，损害皮脂腺和皮肤屏障功能完整性，还会导致皮肤干燥加速肌肤老化\n\n总之，这样使用的后果就是：洗完脸之后，会出现先干后油的情况，或者是一边干燥紧绷一边疯狂出油，甚至脸颊敏感泛红起皮，护肤品不吸收的情况。\n所以我们在选择清洁的基础上一定不能忽视“温和”，\n\n在所有的清洁成分上，我最推荐大家选择“氨基酸”表活，PH值与人体肌肤接近不会破坏皮肤的皮脂腺，\n\n氨基酸表活去油控油的能力非常出色，能够有效的清除皮肤表面的污垢、化妆品残留等。\n再加上氨基酸构成是蛋白质的基本物质，所以温和亲肤，不管是干皮、油皮、敏感肌都可以用！\n前面说了清洁是冬季护肤的第一步，那么舒缓保湿绝对是冬季护肤的重中之重！\n\n冬季空气干燥+昼夜温差大导致皮肤表面油脂分泌减少，皮脂膜保护下降，水分流失，肌肤容易受到损伤，\n\n当肌肤长时间处于缺水状态，不仅会出现皮肤疯狂出油的问题，还会冒出痘痘、黑头、干纹细纹等。\n所以当务之急一定要补水，毕竟水分缺失是导致皮肤变差的原因之一，水分留不住，皮肤问题永远也不会好转。\n\n但是补水并不是用点喷雾就可以了，这种只能缓解一时的皮肤干燥，对于肌底缺水状态根本起不了任何的作用！\n上面说皮肤在长期缺水的状态下，会出现泛红敏感、起皮等问题，本身这些皮肤问题就是屏障受损的一种表现。\n\n换句话说，如果不及时修复皮肤屏障，皮肤不仅抵挡不住外界的各种刺激，还会让肌肤中的水分子悄悄溜走，从而又会引起皮肤问题循环起皮、细纹、干纹...\n当然，如果有了：神经酰胺+泛醇，这两种成分的搭配，那么一切都不是问题！\n\n据我闺蜜说，这两种成分在皮肤科修复界的地位是数一数二的。\n\n神经酰胺可以帮助干痒爆皮的皮肤牢牢锁住水分，还能帮助皮肤修复屏障，提升皮肤的耐受力，从根本上减少泛红敏感的情况。\n\n他科室做过相关的临床试验，皮肤屏障受损患者在使用神经酰胺1周、2周后，红血丝明显减少，敏感问题有显著改善。\n我查到相关的文献显示，神经酰胺已被国家收录在《已使用化妆品原料目录》中，并证实在屏障修复、锁水保湿方面表现卓越。\n而泛醇的分子量较小，它能够渗透到角质层，滋润皮肤表面，起到强保湿的作用，\n\n这样下来，两种成分搭配在一起，相当于给皮肤穿了能抵御魔法的斗篷+提升物理防护的铠甲！\n接下来再和大家说一下我的使用过程和使用感受\n\n这三套刚好可以作为日常护肤使用的，先是氨基酸洗面奶\n\n因为我冬季的皮肤有点油敏皮，有时候上一天班了，三角区和脑门就会比较油，脸颊干，脸颊、嘴角会泛红或者紧绷起皮。\n\n但是这款氨基酸洗面奶泡沫很绵密，每次只用黄豆粒大小就能洗完整张脸，洗完之后也不会有假滑感。\n\n而且用完后，三角区和脑门的油脂好像一下子被清洗干净了，脸颊和嘴角洗完也不会觉得紧绷和灼热感，相反感觉很水润。\n洗完脸之后，我就会用葡聚糖的水乳来舒缓补水的精简护肤\n\n据说像这种精简基础的水乳，才是最适合日常舒缓补水的，一开始我还不信，这次真正使用过后，我才相信\n\n水乳的质地很清透，流动性很好，上脸不粘腻，吸收很快。\n想到之前为了让脸颊嘴角不紧绷起皮，我会往脸上涂比较多的护肤品，什么补水喷雾、水乳精华面霜等强保湿的。\n\n一套连招下来，是不紧绷了起皮了，但三角区和脑门却油的不行，不仅会有油膜、闷肤感，工作一天下来甚至还会长痘痘，眼周会冒出脂肪粒\n\n但是自从用了这款葡聚糖的舒缓补水的基础水乳之后，三角区出油、脸颊紧绷起皮的情况都好转了。\n用完水乳之后，这款神经酰胺就是作为精简护肤的最后一步，用来修复皮肤屏障，锁住皮肤水分\n\n这款神经酰胺面霜我愿称之为冬季脸部敏感泛红的“急救亲妈”！\n\n关键肤感还特别好，质地轻盈不厚重，上脸无负担，不油不粘腻，用完整张脸软软的。\n尤其是因为冷暖风导致的小脸刺痛、发烫泛红的时候用它，真有点清风过山岗的意思！\n\n头天晚上睡前用它，第二天早上起来，脸也是水水嫩嫩的，好像脸上的皮都展开了，非常舒坦。\n该说不说这三套东西使用下来，皮肤是一天比一天好了，\n\n从去年冬天一直用到现在，三种成分的东西，我回购了无数次，\n\n持续搭配着洗面奶、葡聚糖水乳和神经酰胺面霜使用下来，皮肤泛红的情况越来越少，皮肤的状态也肉眼可见的变好，看着就是健康。\n不仅如此，皮肤的底子打牢之后，现在冬天哪怕只涂个水乳出门，都没有拔干、刺痛的感觉了。\n\n现在的皮肤状态稳定之后，熬夜吃重口，皮肤还是妥妥的好！\n\n说真的，建议所有冬季皮肤状态不稳定，会有起皮、泛红的朋友们，都可以尝试我这种方法。\n\n尤其是敏干皮的宝子们，坚持使用一段时间，皮肤泛红、刺痛，包括干痒都会得到一定的好转！",

The final content should be within a 10-minute presentation duration, with a focus on practicality and feasibility.  \nRelevant engineering practice case materials and engineering implementation experience summaries can refer to: A well-known automobile manufacturing enterprise is facing challenges such as diversified market demand, shortened production cycles, and increasing quality requirements. To address these challenges, they decided to implement an intelligent manufacturing upgrade project.  \nFirst, they introduced industrial robots and automated equipment, achieving automated production in processes such as body welding, painting, and assembly. These robots can precisely perform complex operations, not only improving production efficiency but also reducing human errors, thereby enhancing product quality.  \nNext, by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, they interconnected the equipment, components, and products on the production line. Real-time production data, including equipment operating status, production progress, and quality inspection results, are collected. By analyzing this data, the company can quickly identify issues in production and make adjustments and optimizations.  \nFurthermore, they established a digital production management system. From order management and production planning to material delivery, they realized digital control throughout the entire process. This made production plans more accurate, material delivery more timely, and effectively reduced inventory backlog and waste.  \nAfter the intelligent manufacturing upgrade, the company's production efficiency increased by 30%, product defect rate decreased by 20%, and the time to market for new products was shortened, enhancing its market competitiveness.  \n\nCase 2: Intelligent Warehousing and Logistics Management in Electronic Manufacturing  \nA large electronic manufacturing enterprise, due to the wide variety of products and complexity of components, has always faced challenges in warehousing and logistics management. To improve this situation, they implemented an intelligent manufacturing solution.  \nIn warehousing, an automated vertical warehouse was adopted. With stackers, conveyors, and other equipment, automatic storage, retrieval, and handling of goods were achieved. At the same time, a warehouse management system was used to monitor and manage inventory in real time, allowing accurate tracking of stock levels and product locations.  \nIn logistics, an intelligent logistics distribution system was introduced. By integrating with the production system, delivery plans are automatically generated based on production needs, and driverless logistics carts accurately deliver materials to the production line.  \nAdditionally, by leveraging big data and artificial intelligence, logistics data is analyzed and predicted. Material demand is forecasted in advance, logistics routes are optimized, logistics costs are reduced, and logistics efficiency is improved.  \nThrough the implementation of intelligent warehousing and logistics management, the company’s inventory turnover rate increased by 50%, logistics costs decreased by 30%, providing strong support for efficient production.  \n\nI. Summary of Implementation Experience for Intelligent Manufacturing Technology  \n1. Formulating a Clear Development Strategy: Before implementing intelligent manufacturing, companies should clearly define their development strategy, including decisions on which intelligent manufacturing technologies to adopt, which technology providers to choose, and what investments to make. A clear development strategy can effectively guide the company’s decisions and investments throughout the implementation process.  \n2. Strengthening Cooperation with External Partners: The technologies involved in intelligent manufacturing are complex, and it is difficult for companies to complete all technological development and implementation on their own. Therefore, companies should actively establish partnerships with external collaborators, leveraging their expertise and technological strength to jointly promote the implementation of intelligent manufacturing.  \n3. Adapting to the Company’s Actual Situation: When selecting intelligent manufacturing technologies and equipment, companies need to evaluate and choose based on their actual conditions. Different companies have differences in products, production processes, and organizational management, so they should not blindly follow trends. Instead, they should choose the most suitable intelligent manufacturing solution based on their actual situation.  \n4. Establishing a Comprehensive Data Management System: The implementation of intelligent manufacturing technology will inevitably generate large amounts of data, including production data, equipment data, and quality data. To fully utilize this data, companies need to establish a comprehensive data management system to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and security of the data. Additionally, reasonable data analysis and mining should be carried out to provide decision-making references.", "checklist": [{"name": "Structural_Alignment", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response adheres to the requested three-part format (technological pathways, precautions/best practices, application cases) and maintains appropriate balance between sections for a 10-minute presentation.", "1-2": "Completely ignores the requested format, presenting information in a disorganized manner with no clear sections or logical flow.

置优势，任意定价，使得同学们不太愿意在\n那里进行电子产品的维修。因此在大学内部开设电子产品维修店将拥有十分巨大\n的商业机会。而且淮南地区高校内部的电子产品维修市场也整体处于被发掘状态，\n如果能将eFIX这一电子产品专业维修品牌打响，那么其市场收益必将是十分可\n观的。\n我们的优劣势分析：\n优势：\n①技术较高，提升空间较大\n②品种多样，产品多样\n③规模大，价格合理\n④服务态度好\n劣势：\n①如果投资较大，需要资金多\n②产品刚投入市场，还无稳定顾客，将品牌打出需要一定的精力和好的营销策略\n③经营和管理经验不足\n④抗风险的能力较弱\n市场机会：\n①大学生数量的快速增长，成为巨大的具有潜力的消费群体\n②大学生对电脑等各种电子产品的需求日易增长，不仅惠及大学生，还有学校的\n老师及附近的居民\n电子产品市场调研优秀报告范文社会实践报告\n③大学生群体消费能力强。\n20XX电子产品市场调研报告(2) \n20**年消费电子配件产品市场会受哪些技术趋势影响?美国消费电子协会通过最\n新的消费者调研和市场预测，锁定了物联网、无人驾驶汽车、数字医疗健康、未\n来机器人和视频内容策展五个技术。\n在这个市值高达20**亿美元的市场，电子产品会因这些技术做出哪些改变?一起\n看看美国消费电子协会(CEA)的解释：\n趋势一：物联网\n传感器构成了新一代的物物互联。普通物体都通过传感化实现数字化。传感器已\n经开始植入各种物体，比如冲浪板、衬衫、电视机遥控和玩具。下一步便是充分\n利用传感器部署接入电子设备，获取的信息将影响更大规模的用户决策。\n传感器能监控并测量我们通常办不到的事情。当然，这是因为传感器可以数字化\n和进行频繁的计算。\n在这些数据中，算法能发现我们看不到的东西，从而帮助我们克服行为偏见和其\n他阻碍提高效率的问题。我们被数十亿个节点包围着，把它们智能化反而能影响\n我们生活的每一件事情。\n趋势二：无人驾驶汽车\n美国消费电子协会(CEA)的调研表明，司机愿意考虑坐在后座。\n当下，有两大类无人驾驶智能系统：以传感器为基础的和以摄像机为基础的系统。\n以传感器为基础的，这些传感器在功能上是处于盲状态，但它能够传输他们的相\n对位置和状况给另一车辆。\n以摄像机为基础，这些摄像机(或称作一只眼)能在看并探测其边缘内的事物。在\n软件中，这只眼已经被训练避免撞到一定的东西，忽视一定的事物和使用一些物\n体(例如道路标志)。\n技术提高我们生活的尺度在很大程度上取决于我们作为一个社会如何去制定规\n则，接受新责任和回应对稀缺资源如停车场、人行道和电力的需求的转换。\n它会给一些人的生活造成巨大的动荡，同时也会为更多人的生活创造新的机会和\n便利。\n趋势三：数字医疗保健\n应用软件、可穿戴式传感器以及远程监控装置逐渐成为临床护理与日常保健必不\n可少的工具，而这些技术正在改变医患关系，使在家接受治疗成为可能，从而让\n患者更能掌控自身的健康状况。\n2013年美国消费者电子协会(CEA)的一项调研显示，三分之一的移动设备用户曾\n在过去12个月中监测过他们的某些健康指标。而对于监控自身健康状况的智能\n手机用户，有四分之一的人表示会跟他们的医生分享这些信息。\n新一代的医疗保健技术有望实现更加无线化的连接，使病人可以跟医生共享完整\n的治疗历史跟详尽的生理数据，同时也让护理者时刻跟病人保持联系，及时给予\n照料。",

为了确保此项制度能够不折不扣地落到实处，《规定》还明确了对违反任职回避人员的惩戒措施：凡具备任职回避条件的人员在规定期限内不主动提出任职回避申请，应当在申请期限届满之日起六个月内按照程序免去其领导职务或将其调离现有岗位；凡具备任职回避条件的人员有隐瞒其配偶子女从业情况、弄虚作假规避任职回避以及拒不服从组织调动等情况的，应当酌情给予批评教育、组织处理或纪律处分；对于法院领导干部或法官的配偶子女表面上不在所限地域内从事律师职业，而暗地里仍在所限地域内从事律师职业的，应当责令该领导干部辞去领导职务或将该法官调离现有岗位，该领导干部或法官对其配偶子女的行为知情的，还应当同时给予其相应的纪律处分。\n附2：\n北京法院将推最严回避规定 配偶做律师法官须离岗\n配偶或子女是律师，法院领导干部或一线法官必须离岗。这是记者从昨天召开的本市法院队伍建设暨反腐倡廉工作会议上获悉的。\n据了解，今年上半年，最高人民法院将出台《关于对配偶子女从事律师职业的法院领导干部和审判执行岗位法官实行任职回避的规定(试行)》，将是近年来法官任职回避方面最严厉的规定。本市法院将以此为契机，进一步健全司法回避制度，防止法官私人利益与社会公共利益发生冲突，防止人情关系对法院审判工作造成不良影响。本市有不少“法官＋律师”夫妻档，如果推行回避制度，很多一线法官须要离岗，将产生审判资源稀缺问题。\n如此严格的任职回避，此前在上海、重庆等地已经有过试行。以重庆为例，法院在招录或调入工作人员时，把“单方退出”作为刚性前置条件：配偶、子女从事律师职业的人员，不再作为院长、副院长、审判委员会委员、庭长、副庭长的提名人选；已经担任领导职务的，要逐步清理，要么配偶、子女不再从事律师工作，要么本人辞去领导职务。据悉，因回避制度，试点地区已有多名法官因配偶是律师而被调离岗位甚至脱下法袍。\n法官与律师不能同在一个家庭，能杜绝“打官司”变“打关系”的不良行为吗？\n对此，北京市合川律师事务所律师刘铭认为，从律师行业竞争、社会大众公正和法官队伍建设三方面考量，实行回避制度利大于弊。刘律师介绍，一个和法院工作人员有关系的律师，代理案件优势明显大于普通律师是不可否认的现状，这样就造成了律师行业不公平竞争，为打赢官司，律师不追求完善证据，而是想方设法和法官拉关系，律师行业整体发展方向就会出现偏斜。\n如果切断了法官对私情袒护的源头，那么，社会大众也就能接受公平的裁判，不会出现大量的因认为审判不公致缠诉缠访问题。\n对于回避制度剥夺了法官及亲属择业权的质疑，刘律师表示，法官行业是比较特殊的职业，需要“耐得住寂寞”，为了保证法律的公正和社会的正义，法官做出一定牺牲是正常的，就像公众人物要丧失一定隐私权一样。\n当过十几年法官的知名律师张燕生则认为，法院应加强法官独立审判力度，建立法官不受任何因素干扰的审判机制，不应片面地把律师当作法院审判不公的替罪羊。张律师还建议，我国应该逐步改革法官遴选制度，尝试从职业道德高尚、法律水平优秀的律师中选拔法官。她认为，我国毕业生直接走进法院，从社会阅历、财富积累、司法体会和法律认识等方面都局限了法官队伍的能力，导致法官容易受到外界干扰。\n其他亮点\n督察组将检查中级、基层法院\n依据最高法院推出的审务督察制度，今年，市高级法院将向中级、基层法院派出督察组，着重督察审判作风、审判管理方面存在的薄弱环节和漏洞，通过督察督办工作，查漏补缺，强化对违法违纪行为的纠正和惩戒。市高级法院表示，将坚持每年对3到5个基层法院和派出法庭进行日常巡查，同时，针对法院工作中的突出问题开展专项巡查。\n各法院开通信访举报网站\n本市法院还将进一步改进信访举报、案件审理和案件监督管理工作，完善举报受理、线索核查和案件督办机制，中级、基层法院应开通信访举报网站，及时揭露、发现、查处违纪违法案件，重点查处以案谋私、贪赃枉法和严重损害人民群众切身利益的违纪违法案件，对于暴露出的问题，以“零容忍”的态度一查到底，绝不手软。\n铁道部新闻发言人王勇平在7 月24 日晚间的新闻发布会上，被记者问到“为何救援宣\n告结束后仍发现一名生还儿童”时，他答：“这只能说是生命的奇迹”。之后，被问到为何\n要掩埋车头时，王勇平又说出了另一句非常经典的话，“至于你信不信，我反正信了”。\n日前，网民崔勤malisha 以王勇平家庭成员的造句在网络上热传：铁道部发言人王勇平先\n生你好，您的大女儿王晓英是铁道部财务局主任，大女婿李阁奎是北京市交通局副局长，二女儿\n王晓霞是北京市计生局处长，二女婿郭亮是北京市中心医院副院长，小儿子王晓飞是铁道部质检\n科科长，儿媳张宁是市妇联主任。至于你信不信,反正我信了。\n同年7 月中旬，铁道部运输局车辆部副主任刘瑞扬被有关部门带走调查，其妻子、铁道部\n文联副秘书长陈宜涵也在同一天被带走。\n2011 年2 月11 日晚，58 岁的铁道部部长、党组书记刘志军被有关部门带走。关于刘志\n军案，据称他任人唯亲，任内提拔大量亲戚任职铁路系统。他的弟弟刘志祥数年内从一个普通的\n铁道工人做到了火车司机、人事干部、纪委书记、副站长，直至武汉铁路分局副局长、汉口火车\n站站长。可谓“近水楼台先得月。”\n铁路系统人事制度上的“近亲繁殖”不仅容易产生官官相护，令监管和问责制度失效，\n而且许多在责任事故中受处分的官员在事件冷淡后，又以别的职务上任。",

The article should address the following aspects: 1) The process of signing a labor contract and key points to note; 2) The legal obligations of the employer under the labor contract, such as wage payments, vacation arrangements, social insurance contributions, etc.; 3) The legal obligations of employees under the labor contract, such as adhering to work discipline, fulfilling job responsibilities, etc.; 4) The legal provisions regarding the termination and dissolution of labor contracts, as well as reasonable and compliant handling methods; 5) Common legal disputes between employers and employees and their resolution methods. The article may also include typical cases or authoritative data to enhance persuasiveness. The content should be easy to understand, logically clear, appropriately incorporating references and interpretations of relevant laws, and should be within 1500-2000 words. Additionally, the article should consider the new changes in enterprise operations and labor models, appropriately supplementing relevant policies or new regulations since 2020 to ensure the content is up to date.  \nAuthoritative interpretations of the Labor Contract Law of the People’s Republic of China and its related judicial explanations, judgments or mediation solutions of common cases between employers and employees, and excellent practice cases of legal education for enterprise employees can be referenced: **Overview of the Labor Contract Law**\n\nThe \"Labor Contract Law of the People's Republic of China\" is an important law that regulates the labor relationship between employers and employees. It clarifies various aspects of the labor contract, including its formation, performance, modification, termination, and ending, aiming to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees while promoting lawful employment practices by employers.\n\n**Core Contents of the Labor Contract Law**\n\n1. **Formation of the Labor Contract**: Labor contracts should follow the principles of equality, voluntariness, and mutual agreement. The contract must be in writing and include essential clauses such as the employer's name, the employee's name, the contract term, job description, workplace, working hours, rest and leave, labor remuneration, and social insurance.\n\n2. **Performance of the Labor Contract**: Both the employer and employee should fully fulfill their respective obligations as stipulated in the labor contract. The employer must provide the necessary labor protection and working conditions, pay wages on time and in full, and pay social insurance premiums for the employee as required by law.\n\n3. **Modification of the Labor Contract**: During the performance of the labor contract, if circumstances change, the contract may be modified or supplemented with the mutual consent of both parties. The modification should follow the principles of legality, fairness, equality, voluntariness, and mutual agreement.\n\n4. **Termination and End of the Labor Contract**: Under specific circumstances, either the employee or the employer may terminate or end the labor contract in accordance with the law. For example, an employee may terminate the contract if the employer fails to provide labor protection or timely and full payment of wages as stipulated in the contract; the employer may terminate the contract if the employee fails the probation period or seriously violates the employer's rules and regulations.\n\n**Judicial Interpretation of the Labor Contract Law by the Supreme Court**\n\nThe judicial interpretation of the Labor Contract Law by the Supreme Court further refines the rules for its application, providing more specific guidance for handling labor dispute cases. For example, in cases where the labor arbitration committee refuses to accept a labor dispute case on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction, the judicial interpretation clarifies how the people's court should handle such cases. It also details the types and effects of arbitration awards.\n\n**Important Clauses and Interpretations of the Labor Contract Law**\n\n1. **Indefinite-Term Labor Contract**: Employers and employees may agree to enter into an indefinite-term labor contract. In certain situations, such as when an employee has worked continuously for the employer for ten years, an indefinite-term labor contract must be concluded.\n\n2. **Termination of the Labor Contract**: Employees may terminate the labor contract under specific circumstances, such as when the employer fails to provide labor protection or timely and full payment of wages. Similarly, employers may terminate the labor contract when an employee seriously violates the employer's rules and regulations.\n\n3. **Economic Compensation**: When a labor contract is terminated or ended, the employer must pay economic compensation to the employee in accordance with the law. The standards and methods of compensation are clearly stipulated by the law.\n\n**Protection of Employees under the Labor Contract Law**\n\nThe Labor Contract Law provides comprehensive protection for employees through various provisions, such as the formation, performance, modification, termination, and ending of labor contracts. It also stipulates the legal responsibilities of employers, such as the failure to enter into a written labor contract with employees or to pay wages on time and in full, for which the employer will bear corresponding legal liabilities.\n\nA certain primary school in Baishan City, Jilin Province, employed Mr. Qu as a substitute teacher with 11 years of service. During this time, the employer and the employee did not sign a written labor contract for many years and later signed three written labor contracts. After the contract expired, the school verbally informed Mr. Qu of the termination of the labor relationship, without paying economic compensation or making social insurance contributions. Mr. Qu then filed a labor arbitration case, requesting the school to pay economic compensation and make up for the social insurance payments.\n\n**Mediation Plan and Legal Basis**\n\n1. **Legal Responsibility for Not Signing a Written Labor Contract**  \n   Legal Basis: According to Article 10 of the \"Labor Contract Law of the People's Republic of China,\" a written labor contract must be concluded when establishing a labor relationship. If no written contract is signed, one must be signed within one month from the date of employment.  \n   Mediation Result: The school is required to pay double the wages as compensation because it failed to sign a written labor contract with Mr. Qu.\n\n2. **Economic Compensation for Termination of the Labor Contract upon Expiration**  \n   Legal Basis: According to Articles 44 and 46 of the \"Labor Contract Law of the People's Republic of China,\" when a labor contract expires and terminates, the employer should pay economic compensation to the employee unless the employer offers to continue or improve the terms of the contract and the employee refuses to renew.  \n   Mediation Result: Since the school did not notify Mr. Qu in advance about the termination of the labor relationship and did not pay economic compensation, it is required to pay economic compensation.\n\n3. **Payment of Social Insurance**  \n   Legal Basis: According to Article 72 of the \"Labor Law of the People's Republic of China,\" both the employer and employee must participate in social insurance and contribute to social insurance premiums in accordance with the law.  \n   Mediation Result: The school is required to make up for the social insurance contributions.\n\n**Legal Recommendations**\n\nFor Employers:  \n- **Standardize labor contract management**: Ensure that written labor contracts are signed with all employees and clarify key terms such as contract duration, job description, labor remuneration, and social insurance.\n- **Legally terminate labor relationships**: When terminating a labor contract, employers must comply with legal requirements, notify employees in advance, and provide appropriate economic compensation.\n- **Pay social insurance according to the law**: Pay social insurance premiums on time and in full to protect employees' legal rights.\n\nFor Employees:  \n- **Understand your rights**: Familiarize yourself with labor laws and regulations to understand your rights and obligations, such as signing a labor contract, receiving wages, and enjoying social insurance.\n- **Actively protect your rights**: When your rights are infringed upon, take legal action in a timely manner, such as filing for labor arbitration or litigation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDisputes between employers and employees often involve multiple legal issues, including the signing, termination, economic compensation, and social insurance of labor contracts. In resolving these disputes, mediation and judgment should follow relevant laws and regulations to ensure that both parties' legitimate rights are protected. Both employers and employees should also enhance their legal awareness and comply with the law to jointly maintain a harmonious and stable labor relationship.\n\n**Case 1: The \"Legal Three Advances\" Activity of the Autonomous Region Federation of Industry and Commerce**\n\n**Main Practices:**\n\n- **Legal Learning in Government Agencies**: The Federation of Industry and Commerce of the Autonomous Region organized training sessions for executives of regional businesses, inviting officials from the regional supervisory commission to interpret laws through cases and guide private entrepreneurs in compliance with the law and legal operations. At the same time, they organized government staff to study Xi Jinping's legal thoughts and incorporated the Constitution and Civil Code into routine learning.\n- **Legal Services to Enterprises**: After the resumption of work and production, the Federation provided targeted legal services, helping private businesspeople deeply feel the care of the Party and government.\n- **Legal Promotion to Business Associations**: Strengthened management and guidance for business associations, establishing the \"Business Association Lecture Hall,\" regularly organizing legal education, and raising businesspeople's awareness of prevention.\n\n**Results**:  \nThe activity enhanced the legal awareness of private entrepreneurs and business associations, optimized the business environment, and established the mindset that \"the path to happiness has many ways, but abiding by the law is the most important.\"\n\n**Case 2: The \"Zhuo Ji\" Juvenile Legal Education Brand in Lhasa City**\n\n**Main Practices:**\n\n- **Strengthening Organizational Leadership**: The People's Procuratorate of Lhasa established the \"Zhuo Ji\" Juvenile Legal Education Studio, with the chief procurator personally assigning tasks and leading by example, and continuously carrying out the \"Law Into Campus\" initiative.\n- **Forming a Lecture Team**: Integrated the city's juvenile legal education resources and formed the \"Zhuo Ji\" legal education lecture team, holding multiple law education events.\n- **Innovating Legal Education Methods**: Used \"Prosecutor Open Day,\" mock court competitions, legal writing contests, and law-related performances tailored to juveniles' understanding to demonstrate the results of juvenile legal education.\n- **Enriching Legal Education Products**: Produced micro-videos, micro-movies, and published law education materials, including a braille manual for juvenile legal education.\n- **Creating Education Bases**: Established a comprehensive legal education base for juvenile crime prevention, cultivating legal thinking in young people through diverse and rich content.\n\n**Results**:  \nThe initiative increased legal awareness among juveniles and improved their legal literacy through innovative legal education methods, strengthening their understanding of the rule of law.\n\n**Case 3: The \"Rule of Law + Intangible Cultural Heritage\" Legal Education Brand in Dongli District, Tianjin**\n\n**Main Practices:**\n\n- **Creating Legal Paper-Cuts**: Collaborated with Tianjin's intangible cultural heritage \"Da Zheng Paper-Cutting\" to create rule-of-law themed paper cuts, holding traveling exhibitions.\n- **Window-style Legal Education**: Displayed legal paper cuts in public legal service centers, distributed brochures, and used electronic screens to spread legal knowledge.\n- **Experience-based Legal Education**: Invited intangible heritage practitioners to guide the public in experiencing paper-cutting arts while embedding legal principles.\n- **Immersive Legal Education**: Brought the exhibitions to schools to promote legal concepts among young people.\n- **Collaborative Legal Education**: Held rule-of-law paper-cutting exhibitions with enterprises and educational institutions", "checklist": [{"name": "Legal Accuracy and Comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how accurately the article presents the legal content of the Labor Contract Law, including rights and obligations, and how comprehensively it covers all five required aspects mentioned in the query.", "1-2": "Contains significant legal inaccuracies or misinterpretations;

{"index": 984, "domain1": "Literature & Arts", "domain2": "Brainstorm", "query": "Please help me brainstorm a youth suspense novel, with the following requirements:\n1. The protagonist is a high school girl, and the story takes place in a school setting.\n2. The story must incorporate surreal elements.\n3. Please follow the outline format below to develop the plot:\n- Basic protagonist setup (personality traits/family background)\n- Core storyline (at least 3 main plotlines)\n- Important supporting characters (at least 3)\n- Specific design of surreal elements (must be closely tied to the story’s plot)\n- Climax and ending of the story\n4. Each section should be described in at least 500 words.\n5. Please refer to the writing style of the Japanese mystery novel \"Another,\" creating an eerie atmosphere in a school setting.\n6. The total word count should be no less than 5000 words.\nUse typical scenes and character relationships from real school life, psychological insights into teenagers, and materials on urban legends/supernatural phenomena, as well as collections of school horror stories. To understand how to set up suspenseful elements in a school setting, refer to: Xiao Gang is a first-year high school student. At this age, children should typically be lively and cheerful, blending well with their classmates. However, Xiao Gang is different. His interpersonal relationships are poor, and most of the students in his class are unwilling to talk to him, let alone play with him. The teacher has tried to communicate with Xiao Gang multiple times, but the irritable Xiao Gang refuses to listen to the teacher and even speaks disrespectfully to them. Gradually, the lonely Xiao Gang became more sensitive. He even started to physically fight with his classmates over trivial matters. Once, because a classmate from his dormitory said that he hadn't folded his quilt properly, causing the dormitory to miss out on the \"Excellent Dormitory\" award, Xiao Gang became so angry over this minor issue that he severely injured his classmate. The teacher invited Xiao Gang's parents to discuss the issue and hoped to solve Xiao Gang's problems together. Xiao Gang's mother was deeply distressed by her son's behavior and scolded him severely. Feeling helpless, Xiao Gang thought that he had been abandoned by his family, teachers, and classmates. He began to self-harm, believing that physical pain would bring him relief. This behavior frightened Xiao Gang's mother, and in a panic, she contacted our psychological health counseling center.\n\nWhen the counselor first met Xiao Gang, they noticed the numerous scars on his arms, left from his self-harm—bruises, blood clots, and old marks from sharp objects. During the session, Xiao Gang was uncooperative. He believed that everything he had done was right. His classmates ignored him, his teachers were helpless, and even his mother's scolding was because they didn't understand him or the true thoughts in his heart. Based on Xiao Gang's psychological issues, the counselor used Rational Emotive Therapy, helping him build the correct mindset, develop a sense of collective honor and responsibility, and cultivate a friendly attitude toward his classmates. After a period of treatment, Xiao Gang regained his confidence and returned to school. Through follow-up visits, we learned that Xiao Gang apologized to his classmates as soon as he returned to school. Now, their relationship has greatly improved, and Xiao Gang can communicate normally with his classmates.\n\nOfficially, the psychological development of high school students is clearly more mature than that of middle school students, reaching a higher level of development. First, their cognitive abilities continue to develop. Their perception becomes more purposeful and systematic, their observational skills greatly improve, becoming more precise and detailed; attention becomes more stable; memory shifts from mechanical memory to understanding-based memory; thinking shows a higher level of abstraction and generalization, with logical thinking taking a dominant position. Their thinking has deepened, become more independent, and more critical; imagination has also become increasingly rich and novel. The improvement in cognitive abilities provides conditions for high school students to learn complex scientific knowledge and complete heavier academic tasks. Secondly, their emotional processes develop rapidly. High school students experience emotions and feelings more intensely and passionately, with emotions more stable and deep than middle school students, tending to be introverted and differentiated. Their patriotism and collectivism are stronger, connected with a sense of social responsibility. Their sense of friendship has also increased in rationality and depth, often seeking friendship based on moral agreement and shared ideals and ambitions. Friendly expressions between boys and girls are increasing, and under proper education and guidance, they can usually control their behavior and emotions, showing moral maturity and emotional depth. Thirdly, their willpower and self-awareness improve. The level of willpower is still not very high, but their self-awareness has clearly improved compared to middle school students. Suggestibility is reduced, and their determination to overcome difficulties has strengthened. Their ability to self-regulate gradually improves, although they sometimes act out of loyalty, requiring teachers to provide timely assistance.\n\nThis story was heard later, although I experienced it myself, I have no impression of it—my mom was holding me while watching the excitement.\n\nIt was a young rural woman who had been married for less than two years and gave birth to a son. Unfortunately, she fell ill and couldn't recover, leaving the child without anyone to care for him. His aunt took him in. The aunt also had her own children, and the two kids played together without much issue. But one day, the child accidentally broke a bowl while eating. His aunt got angry and slapped him twice. The child began to cry, and that was when things went wrong.\n\nIt is said that the aunt suddenly screamed, her eyes rolled back, and she collapsed. When she stood up again, her voice and walking posture had completely changed. The familiar people immediately recognized her—it was as if she had become the dead mother of the child.\n\nSoon, the village was in an uproar, and many people gathered to watch (my mom was holding me among them). The aunt was crying and wailing inside, speaking in the tone of the child's dead mother, blaming the aunt for hitting the child. Some older relatives began to persuade her, explaining that the aunt had actually treated the child very well. After a while, the aunt stopped her commotion and started chatting with the people. Many old acquaintances came over to greet her, asking, \"Do you know who I am?\" The aunt responded, \"Of course, you are so-and-so, right? We used to make shoes together.\"\n\nSome elders were worried about trouble and advised her, saying, \"Look, everything's fine now. You should go back, and we will take good care of your child.\" The aunt agreed, \"Okay, I'll leave.\" She parted the crowd and began walking toward the village outskirts. People followed her, and as they approached the child's mother's grave, the aunt suddenly tripped and fell. Everyone helped her up, and she looked bewildered, asking, \"Why am I here? What are you all doing?\" The elders told her, \"Don't worry about us. Just promise that you will never hit the child again.\"\n\nWriting Techniques\n- Define roles and rules:  \n  Identify characters in the story, including students, teachers, and school staff, and establish some special rules or taboos related to the school. For example, \"Do not enter the old school building after 11 PM\" or \"Don't turn around in the school corridor.\"  \n  These rules can serve as the framework of the story, guiding the plot's development.\n\n- Explore hidden conditions and misleading information:  \n  Add hidden conditions or misleading information based on the rules to increase the complexity and suspense of the story.  \n  For example, the hidden condition of \"Do not make eye contact with the teacher in the classroom\" might only apply in certain situations or times.\n\n- Use breaking of rules to drive the plot:  \n  Allow characters to attempt breaking rules, using this as the driving force of the plot. However, violations of rules should have consequences to maintain the tension.\n\nCommon Elements\n- Cursed Stairs:  \n  Describe a staircase that becomes unusually terrifying at specific times or under certain conditions, such as steps that change in number or strange creatures appearing.\n\n- Red Swimming Pool:  \n  A pool that becomes dangerous at certain times (like sunset), where swimmers might be dragged into the water by an unknown force.\n\n- Old School Building's Bathroom:  \n  A bathroom that leads to another world or holds unspeakable secrets.\n\n- Ghost in the Cooking Room:  \n  A female ghost or other spirits appearing in the cooking classroom, but not necessarily very frightening.\n\n- Endless Corridor:  \n  A corridor that seems to stretch infinitely, preventing the person from ever reaching the end.\n\nStory Structure\n- Introduction:  \n  Set the background of the story, introducing the main characters and the ghostly rumors about the school.\n\n- Development:  \n  The characters gradually delve deeper into the truth behind the ghost stories, facing a series of terrifying events.\n\n- Climax:  \n  The characters are faced with life-or-death decisions and must choose how to escape the terrifying situation.\n\n- Conclusion:  \n  Reveal the true cause of the ghost story or provide a solution, giving the story a satisfying conclusion.\n\nCreating a Horrifying Atmosphere\n- Utilize environmental description:  \n  Detail the school's old and dark environment, as well as the silence and loneliness of the night.\n\n- Create suspense and tension:  \n  Use the characters' psychological activities and dialogues to convey fear, such as hesitation, anxiety, and nervousness.\n\n- Employ horror elements:  \n  Use mysterious creatures, ghosts, bloodstains, etc., but do so sparingly to avoid excessive violence or gore.\n\nExamples and Suggestions\n- Example:  \n  You could describe a student staying at school alone at night, hearing strange sounds coming from the old school building. He curiously enters and discovers that the number of stairs keeps changing, as if he can never reach the top. In despair, he sees the ghost of a girl in a school uniform, who tells him he must follow the school's rules to leave. Ultimately, he escapes the building by following the rules and bravely facing his fears.\n\n- Suggestions:  \n  In the creative process, focus on detailed descriptions and character development to make the story feel more realistic and credible. At the same time, carefully control the use of horror elements to avoid going overboard or becoming too bland.Content is blocked", "checklist": [{"name": "Plot Comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how thoroughly the response addresses all required elements of the youth suspense novel, including protagonist setup, core storyline, supporting characters, surreal elements, and climax/ending.

If you haven’t left your mark here, it’s as if you haven’t really visited Beijing. Most people who wander around the city haven’t considered these old alleys, which remain a blurry concept to them, much like how there can be both vibrant sunlight and a dusty, shadowed city. The sunshine of spring represents every bit of vitality. A hutong may be a vague concept, yet it has immersed itself in its own life. Even a rusty old truck can’t carry the history of what once was. Riding your old bicycle through Beijing's old hutongs, feeling the changes of the seasons, experiencing these scenes in the alleys and snapping photos of your street corner, you'll realize that Beijing is a sandwich of soy bean juice and candied hawthorn. Walk with me on the streets of a Beijing courtyard house, with the birds chirping above in the hutong. Through the passage of time, the Beijing hutong stretches at its own pace, like an elderly person weathered by a hundred years, only such a hutong can bear the weight of light and shadow, delicately carved with youth’s memories. The sounds of children playing and the conversations of the elders during tea breaks in the weathered hutongs spill their words slowly, echoing in time. The chirping of whistles and the babbling of children can only be fully appreciated by walking with me through the sounds of these hutongs. It’s no surprise that Nanluoguxiang is famous, as this is one of the most bustling and fashionable alleys in Beijing, with bar lights flashing and the clever fusion of gray walls and earthy tiles. It hides a distinct Beijing flavor. The alley is packed with all kinds of old Beijing flavors, from little shops to stylish homes, offering a true taste of the capital. The courtyards within each hutong hold endless stories of famous people, quirky events, charming little shops, stylish street houses, and the taste of private home cooking that blends with the hustle of the alley.

Its original statement is: Any object will maintain uniform linear motion or rest until an external force compels it to change its state of motion.  \nAny object, when not subjected to external forces or when the sum of the external forces acting on it is zero, will maintain a state of uniform linear motion or rest. It explains that an object will keep its original state of motion unless acted upon by an external force. This law also demonstrates that objects have the property of maintaining their original motion state, known as inertia.  \nNewton's First Law applies to macroscopic objects in low-speed motion. The law explains that in the absence of external forces, objects will keep their original state of motion until an external force compels them to change their motion state. When a point mass is not acted upon by external forces, it can be determined whether the point mass is at rest or in uniform linear motion, and the reference frame for this must be an inertial reference frame. Therefore, Newton's First Law of Motion only applies in inertial reference frames.  \n\n**Understanding the Law**  \n**Type II** Instantaneous Problems and Two Models  \n**Type III** Overweight and Weightlessness Problems  \n**Type 1** Image Problems of Overweight and Weightlessness Phenomena  \n**Type 2** Analysis and Calculation of Overweight and Weightlessness Phenomena  \n**Type IV** Two Basic Dynamics Problems  \n**Type 1** Given the Forces, Determine the Motion  \n**Type 2** Given the Motion, Analyze the Forces  \n**Type 3** Forces and Linear Motion in Complex Processes  \n**Type V** Smooth Models  \n**Type 1** Smooth Inclined Plane with Equal Base  \n**Type 2** Inclined Plane with Equal Height  \n**Type 3** \"Isochronous Circle\" Model  \n\n**Experiment Name**: Newton's Pendulum Experiment  \n**Experiment Purpose**: To study energy conservation and momentum conservation  \n**Experimental Equipment**: Several short wooden sticks, fine strings, 5 glass balls, glue, scissors  \n**Experimental Setup**:  \nThe Newton's Pendulum experiment was first proposed by the French physicist Edme Mariotte.

Autumn is a season where skin issues such as dryness and sensitivity are more common, making skincare a focus of attention. This article will introduce a set of autumn skincare product promotion plans, aimed at providing consumers with high-quality skincare products and helping them resolve skin issues.\n\n**2. Background Analysis**  \nIn autumn, temperatures gradually drop, and the air becomes dry, easily leading to moisture loss in the skin and triggering various skin problems. Therefore, choosing the right skincare products has become a common need. Market research data shows that most people have a higher demand for moisturizing, repairing, and anti-sensitive products in autumn. Thus, when formulating the autumn skincare promotion plan, it is important to meet consumer needs and provide products that align with market trends.\n\n**3. Promotion Plan**  \n**3.1 Product Selection: Moisturizing, Repairing, and Anti-Sensitivity Products**  \nBased on market demand, we recommend promoting moisturizing, repairing, and anti-sensitivity products. Moisturizing products can help replenish the skin's moisture and enhance its moisturizing ability; repairing products can repair damaged areas of the skin and help restore skin health; anti-sensitivity products can relieve discomfort caused by sensitive skin. These three types of products have high market demand and will help drive sales growth.\n\n**3.2 Product Packaging Design**  \nIn the autumn skincare promotion plan, product packaging design can attract consumer attention. The theme colors for autumn can focus on soft, warm tones such as orange, yellow, and brown to create a warm, comfortable feel. At the same time, simple and clear fonts and graphic designs can be used to highlight product features and brand image. Additionally, the packaging should be practical and portable, making it convenient for consumers to carry and use.\n\n**3.3 Pricing Strategy**  \nWhen formulating the autumn skincare promotion plan, setting reasonable prices is crucial. The pricing strategy can be based on market research data and competitors’ prices. According to the product quality and market competition situation, appropriate discounts can be set to attract consumers' attention and increase sales volume. Furthermore, some sets or limited edition products can be launched to increase the added value and appeal of the product.\n\n**3.4 Promotion Channels**  \nIn the autumn skincare promotion plan, selecting the right promotion channels is also very important. Sales can be carried out through major e-commerce platforms, offline supermarkets, and counters. Additionally, social platforms, WeChat official accounts, etc., can be used for publicity and promotion to attract more consumers' attention and purchases. Collaborating with beauty bloggers and beauty influencers for product trials and reviews can also increase the product's exposure.\n\n**4. Necessary Measures and Expected Effects**  \nThrough the implementation of the autumn skincare promotion plan, the following effects are expected:  \n- Enhance brand awareness and reputation.  \n- Increase product sales and market share.  \n- Satisfy consumer needs and solve skin problems.  \n- Improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\n**5. Conclusion**  \nThe autumn skincare promotion plan is an important measure to meet consumer needs. By selecting the right skincare product categories, packaging design, pricing strategy, and promotion channels, sales volume and market competitiveness can be improved.
